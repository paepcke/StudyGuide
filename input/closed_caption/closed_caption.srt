00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,710
In this section, I want to add the idea of variables to code.

1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,420
A variable in the computer is sort of like a box.

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,740
So, here, if I have code like this where I

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,850
say x is equal to 7, semicolon, what that means is

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,666
there&#39;s a box in the computer labeled x, as I&#39;ve

5
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,480
drawn here, and this just stores a 7 into that box.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,550
Or we could store any value we wanted.

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,990
Then later in the code, if wherever an x appears, the computer

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,050
knows to use 7 or whatever it is I put in there.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,100
So in effect, the variable becomes sort of a,

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,740
a convenient shorthand for whatever value I want to use.

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,790
So let me show you how this is going to work in typically in CS101.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,520
I&#39;ll have a line like this, x equals 7, so that just puts a 7 in the box.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,629
And then on the later lines, I will use that variable.

14
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:54,006
So I&#39;ll say, here it says print x or lucky x or actually, x is x.

15
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:56,010
So let me just try running that.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,180
And what you see is the 7 just shows up through here because any

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,194
place I used x, the computer is pulling the value out of the box.

18
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:04,279
This makes it convenient to change.

19
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:07,183
So for example, if I change this to 4x equals 42

20
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:10,990
and run it, now the 42 shows up all over the place.

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,430
Or works for strings too.

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,420
I could say x equals quote hi quote, and

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,180
run it, and we get the hi all through there.

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,930
I should mention this use of equals to in the computer just puts a value in the box.

25
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,150
That&#39;s the only way we are going to use it.

26
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,394
In mathematics, the equals sign has a

27
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:31,450
different, and kind of a, a stronger meaning.

28
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,028
In mathematics, the equals sign means the two values are the same

29
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,293
at all times, and that is not what it means in the computer.

30
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:42,280
In, in this use it is a simpler, just assign value into box.

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,050
So let me try let me work this little problem.

32
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,310
So this says you know, write code to produce this

33
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,150
output, Alice Alice Alice, I had a crush on Alice.

34
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,680
And it says, do it in a way that we

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,620
can change the name very easily, so use a variable.

36
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,900
I put a little code here to start just to remind you of the syntax,

37
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,320
but it, this doesn&#39;t do anything like we, want we wanted, so I&#39;ll fix it.

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,393
So, I&#39;m going to say x is equal to quote Alice.

39
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:17,020
And then inside here, I&#39;ll just say x, x.

40
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,300
X will just try, this is not a complete solution, we&#39;ll just try it as we go.

41
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,787
So if I run that, right, we get the three Alices

42
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:25,935
and then I had this, I had a crush on thing.

43
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:35,030
So I&#39;ll say print quote, I had a crush on, comma and I&#39;ll say, x.

44
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,370
So that way, it&#39;ll just use whatever we had in the box there.

45
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,118
So if I run that, all right, that looks right.

46
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:44,039
And then this has the, the the desired feature that if

47
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,421
I changed this to like, if I just say x equals Zoe

48
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:48,624
at the top, then it just says Zoe, or I could

49
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:52,047
say, you know, Bob or whatever, or you know, bleh, let&#39;s say.

50
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,429
Then like, it just shows up all [INAUDIBLE].

51
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:56,327
So this shows those kind of shorthand nature of variables

52
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:58,930
and that&#39;s the way we&#39;re going to use them in CS101.

53
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,740
So, that&#39;s how to use variables in code, so try it yourself now in the exercises.
