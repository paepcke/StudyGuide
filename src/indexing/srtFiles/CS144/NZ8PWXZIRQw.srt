The answer is yes. If an eavesdropper named
Eve hears both C1 and C2, she can reconstruct

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:15,090
M1 XOR M2. If M1 and M2 are ASCII text messages,
this could provide a lot of information. Since

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,680
C1 XOR C2 is equal to M1 XOR K XOR M2 XOR
K, the two Ks cancel. This means that C1 XOR

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:32,439
C2 is equal to M1 XOR M2.
As a trivial example, if it happens to be

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,530
that M1 is equal to M2, then Eve can figure
this out, since C1 and C2 will be the same.

6
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,759
There’s a reason why it’s called a one-time
pad! Only use it once.
