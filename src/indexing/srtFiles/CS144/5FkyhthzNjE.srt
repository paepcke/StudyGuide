1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,419
Let’s walk through the answers.

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:06,749
The answer to the first row is no. They are
in different networks. The two addresses differ

3
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:11,860
in their second octet -- 34 versus 35. If
we take a bitwise AND of the two addresses

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:18,860
with the netmask, we get 128.34.0.0 and 128.35.0.0,
which are not the same.

5
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:24,579
The answer to the second row is yes. They
are in the same network. If we take a bitwise

6
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:31,519
AND of the two addresses with the netmask,
we get 10.0.1.0 in both cases.

7
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,270
The answer to the third row is no. They are
not in the same network, because they differ

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:41,340
in their third octet. The source is in network
10.0.1.0, while the destination is in network

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:41,780
10.0.2.0.

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:48,780
The answer to the fourth row is no. They are
on in the same network. Just think of the

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,610
last byte. The address on the left, with 33,
is 0x21. The address on the right is 0x05.

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,970
224 is 0xE0, which is three bits. Since the
source has this bit set but the destination

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,900
doesn’t, they don’t match. ANDed with
the netmask, the source address is 171.64.15.32,while

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,540
the destination is 171.64.15.0.

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,250
The answer to the final row is yes. They match
in the first byte: both are 171.0.0.0 when

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,439
ANDed with the netmask.
