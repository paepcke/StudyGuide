1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,010
When we read about computer networks in the
newspaper, it’s often because they have

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,290
been attacked or compromised. Almost every
week we read about hackers breaking in and

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,509
walking off with millions of credit card numbers
and other private data, perhaps following

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:19,130
a phishing attack or by exploiting some other
vulnerability to access a supposedly private

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,410
network. Or we read about a new worm that
Is designed to take over computers turning

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:30,410
them into botnets, such as the infamous Code
Red and Slammer worms of the early 2000s.

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,600
Botnets are armies of infected computers,
controlled by a master, that are commonly

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,399
used to send SPAM. While SPAM levels appear
to be dropping slightly, reports suggest that

9
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,829
between 75% and 95% of emails sent every day
are SPAM, adding up to hundreds of millions

10
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:54,149
of emails per day. Worms are also sent by
one government to attack another. For example

11
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,319
when the 2010 Stuxnet worm – which is widely
believed to have been created by the US and

12
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:05,979
Israel - to attack centrifuges used for processing
nuclear material in Iran.

13
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:10,409
In this video we’ll look at some of the
ways a network can be compromised by an attacker,

14
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,229
and I’ll explain the security characteristics
we want from a network.

15
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:20,280
Let’s start by exploring the different ways
a communication can be compromised.

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,229
The first and simplest method is for an attacker
to Eavesdrop on someone’s else’s private

17
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:30,229
communication . This means passively sniffing
and recording network data. Or it could mean

18
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:34,560
listening to the metadata, such as noting
that a connection has been made, without necessarily

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,909
recording the data in the connection. Connection
metadata was made infamous recently when the

20
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:44,939
NSA acknowledged recording information about
calls and connections made, without – suuposedly

21
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,450
- recording the contents.

22
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,140
There are many ways to tap a network. For
example, at the physical layer an attacker

23
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,499
might passively tap an electrical or optical
cable. Or – as you have seen before – we

24
00:01:57,499 --> 00:02:02,640
can listen-in to WiFi because the packets
are broadcast for everyone to hear. A third

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,539
way is for an attacker to persuade a router
to duplicate and forward copies of packets.

26
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:13,340
In each case, the attacker can use standard
tools such as wireshark to decode the protocols

27
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,980
and understand the user’s data.

28
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,659
A second type of compromise is when an attacker
modifies, deletes or inserts data as it passes

29
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:26,010
through the network. In other words, they
are actively tampering with our data by Changing

30
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,069
the contents of the packets, redirecting packets
to a different, rogue server without us knowing,

31
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:35,730
or taking over control of our end host. This
might happen by persuading us to download

32
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,040
malware based on a phishing attack, or by
exploiting a vulnerability in our computer

33
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,769
or the way we communicate. For example, later,
we’ll see how it is possible to hijack an

34
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,170
ongoing TCP connection without either end
knowing.

35
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,480
Finally, an attacker might just want to prevent
us from communicating. This kind of attack

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,040
is usually called a denial of service attack.
Sometimes these attacks are performed by swamping

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,959
servers or entire networks by generating billions
of messages from different botnets spread

38
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,549
around the Internet. We’ll learn more about
Denial of Service attacks in a later video.

39
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:13,599
Let’s take a look at an example.

40
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,840
Imagine that Alice is making a purchase online
from an e-commerce site. She is using her

41
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,430
laptop, connected to her local WiFi access
point, then over the Internet to Amazon.com.

42
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:32,180
She browses the site and makes her credit-card
purchase using vanilla http. Unfortunately,

43
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:39,099
what she doesn’t know is the bad guy Attacker
is listening in to what she is doing.

44
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:44,849
There are a few ways the Attacker can eavesdrop.
For example, by simply listening or sniffing

45
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:49,959
the WiFi packets broadcast into the air. Anyone
with a laptop and the Wireshark tool can listen

46
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,930
to packets in the air and – if they are
not encrypted – decode their contents. Alternatively,

47
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,829
the attacker can eavesdrop on the physical
wire, by placing a passive detector to pick

48
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:05,760
up small electromagnetic signals that leak
from the cable. Or the attacker might insert

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,659
an electrical connection onto the wire. If
the attacker is eavesdropping on a long haul

50
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:15,420
link in the Internet backbone, they are more
likely to be tapping into an optical fiber.

51
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,609
This can be done by placing a device called
an optical coupler which diverts a small fraction

52
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:27,050
of the optical signal onto a second optical
fiber which can then be listened to and decoded.

53
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,060
An attacker without physical access might
manage to subvert the switches and routers

54
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,680
along the path, tricking one of them into
duplicating data and forwarding it to the

55
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,139
attacker’s computer. This can be done by
remotely subverting Ethernet, IP or DNS traffic.

56
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:47,479
We’ll see examples of all three later. Or
the attacker might manage to break into the

57
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:52,060
router console and take over the router completely.

58
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,500
In our example, if the attacker successfully
eavesdrops on the clear http communication,

59
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,180
he or she can learn Alice’s private data,
such as her credit card number and her home

60
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,340
address.
In a later video we’ll learn more about

61
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:12,340
https prevents this from happening in practice.

62
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,400
If the attacker is able to insert herself
into the middle of the communication, between

63
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,280
Alice and Amazon.com, then the Attacker can
terminate the http connection in the middle,

64
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,280
pretending to be Amazon to Alice, and pretending
to be Alice to Amazon. The Attacker could

65
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,259
simply pass through the data, recording it
without changing it. Or the Attacker could

66
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,400
alter the data, for example to modify the
shipping address, causing the purchased items

67
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,660
to be delivered to the Attacker instead of
Alice. So called Man in the Middle attacks

68
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,449
are very hard to detect, because both parties
can think they are talking to a legitimate

69
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:56,729
end host.

70
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,870
A third line of attack is to redirect the
traffic away from the server without Alice

71
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,520
realizing that she is not actually talking
to Amazon. If the Attacker is able to fool

72
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,039
a router to forward packets destined to Amazon.com
to the Attacker instead, then the Attacker

73
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,210
can respond and pretend to be Amazon. Or the
Attacker might fool Alice’s DNS server into

74
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,960
returning the Attacker’s IP adddress when
Alice is trying to lookup Amazon’s IP address.

75
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,509
In each case, Alice can be forced to browse
the Attacker’s website and be encouraged

76
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:34,509
to enter her credit card information.

77
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:41,310
Clearly Alice is not happy and would like
her communication to be more secure. In general,

78
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,639
when we say we want secure communications
over the Internet we are saying that we want:

79
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,240
Secrecy/confidentiality: We don’t want anyone
to listen-in to our communication. For this,

80
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,419
we use encryption and we will describe how
it works in one of the upcoming videos.

81
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:04,139
Integrity – We don’t want our messages
to be altered in transit. The most common

82
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,259
way to prove that a message has not been tampered
with is to attach what is called a message

83
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:13,560
authentication code, or MAC. MACs are based
on encryption as well, coupled with calculating

84
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,680
a hash over the transmitted message. WE’ll
study message authentication codes in an upcoming

85
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,349
video.
Authentication – We often want to confirm

86
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:27,860
the identity of the other party we are communicating
with. In our example, Alice wants to know

87
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,919
that she is really talking to Amazon – who
she trusts – before entering her credit

88
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,960
card details. In a later video we will study
digital signatures and certificates that help

89
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,360
us ensure that we are really communicating
with who we think we are.

90
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,729
Finally, we want: Uninterrupted communication
– We don’t want someone to prevent us

91
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:51,610
from communicating. You may have heard of
denial of service attacks where an attacker

92
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,199
floods a network or a set of servers to prevent
them from working properly. We will study

93
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,479
denial of service attacks shortly.

94
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,099
And so in the next few videos we will study
different types of attack

95
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:09,680
Eavesdropping.
Redirecting Ethernet, IP and DNS traffic.

96
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,979
Hijacking a running TCP connection.
Denial of service.
