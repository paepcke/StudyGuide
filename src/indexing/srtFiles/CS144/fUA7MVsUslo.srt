1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,640
The answer for A, 63.19.5.3, is link 3. 63.19.5.3
matches two prefixes: the default route and

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:16,230
prefix 63.19.5.0/30. The prefix is 30 bits
long and 63.19.5.3 differs in only the last

3
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:24,150
two bits. /30 is a longer prefix than /0 so
the router will pick link 3.

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:31,150
The answer for B,171.15.15.0, is link 4. 171.15.15.0
matches three entries. It matches the default

5
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:39,590
route, 171.0.0.0/8 and 171.0.0.0/10. It does
not match 171.0.15.0/24 because Bâ€™s second

6
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:54,019
octet is 15, not 0. The third match, 171.0.0.0/10,
is the longest prefix, so the router sends

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,249
the packet along link 4.

8
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:05,610
The answer for C, 63.19.5.32, is link 1. The
longest prefix match is the default route.

9
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,670
It does not match 63.19.5.0/30 because it
differs in the 26th bit.

10
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,670
The answer for D, 44.199.230.1, is link 1.
The longest prefix match is the default route.

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,360
The answer for E, 171.128.16.0, is link 2.
This address matches two prefixes, the default

12
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:33,950
route and 171.0.0.0/8. It does not match 171.0.0.0/10
because it differs on the 9th bit. 171.0.0.0/8

13
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:42,619
is the longest prefix, so the router will
forward the packet on link 2.
