1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,479
So how are IP addresses assigned? Originally,
they were broken up into three classes: class

2
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:11,030
A, class B, and class C. Each class separated
an IP address into two part, network and host.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,850
The network part of the address denoted an
administrative domain, such as MIT, BBN, or

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,940
Stanford University. The host part of the
address denoted which device within that network.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,010
Class A addresses had a leading 0, 7 bits
of network (for 128 networks) and 24 bits

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,570
of host, so could cover 16 million computers.
Class B addresses had 16 bits of host, so

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,570
could cover 65,536 computers. Class C addresses
had 8 bits of host, so could cover 256 computers.

8
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:44,559
While classes A, B, and C are simple, we quickly
found out they were not flexible enough. For

9
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,999
example, both MIT and Stanford received one
of the first class A address blocks - over

10
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:53,870
4 million addresses. For a while, MIT would
give each of its dorms the equivalent of a

11
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:59,299
class B -- 65,000 addresses for a few hundred
people! When IP addresses were plentiful,

12
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:03,170
this wasn’t a problem, but as their use
increased we needed a better allocation policy.

13
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:09,010
A useful note: Stanford gave up its class
A block in 1999, MIT still has its.

14
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:14,460
Today, IPv4 addresses are structured thought
something called CIDR, or Classless Inter-Domain

15
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,370
Routing. Rather than have prefixes only of
length 8, 16, and 24 bits, CIDR allows prefixes

16
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:26,060
to be any number of bits. This means all CIDR
prefixes define a block of addresses that

17
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,220
is a power of 2 in size. When we talk about
a CIDR address, we refer to its netmask length.

18
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,750
So, for example, when we talk about a “slash
16”, we mean a netmask of length 16. This

19
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,750
CIDR block describes 2 to the 16 addresses,
or 65,536. When we talk about a “slash 20”,

20
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:51,110
we mean a netmask of length 20. This CIDR
block describes 2 to the 12 addresses, or

21
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:57,530
4.096 addresses. CIDR blocks are how addresses
are structured, addressed, and managed today.

22
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:04,290
Stanford today has 5 /16 blocks, about 325,000
IPv4 addresses.

23
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,289
So how are IPv4 addresses allocated and managed?
There’s an organization called IANA, for

24
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:13,090
the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. The
ultimate authority is ICANN, the Internet

25
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,499
Corporation for Assignment of Names and Numbers.
ICANN delegates the work to IANA.

26
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:23,639
IANA gives out slash-8s, describing 16 million
addresses, to Regional Internet Registries,

27
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:29,969
or RIRs. Each continent has its own RIR. The
RIR for the United States is ARIN, while the

28
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:35,829
RIR for the western Pacific is APNIC. These
RIRs each have their own policy for how they

29
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:40,209
break up the /8s into smaller blocks of addresses
and assign them to parties who need them.

30
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:43,879
You might have read in the news is that we’ve
run out of IP addresses. This isn’t really

31
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:49,109
true -- there are many unused addresses today.
What *did* happen is that IANA ran out of

32
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:54,230
/8s to give out. It reached a special end
case in its charter. When reduced to its last

33
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:01,230
5 /8s, IANA gave one /8 to each RIR. Now address
management and allocation is up to RIRs. In

34
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:07,200
2012, Jon Peterson, then a member of the Internet
Architecture Board, gave a talk at Stanford

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,999
on some of the political, economic, and technical
complications this raises. The talk isn’t

36
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:17,590
required material for this course, but I recommend
it highly.

37
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,139
So now you’ve seen the structure of IPv4
addresses, how they are allocated, and how

38
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,510
end hosts make their first hop routing decisions,
that is, whether to send to a local node or

39
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,769
their gateway router. Addresses today are
managed and allocated in terms of CIDR blocks,

40
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:36,590
whose size is defined by their prefix length.
A shorter prefix, say, a /8, is a larger block

41
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,609
than a longer prefix, say, a /10.
