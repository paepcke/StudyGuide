1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,560
Nick: Introduction to Computer Networks teaches
you the basic principles of computer networks.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,630
Philip Levis – glance – and I will teach
these principles using the Internet as an

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,080
example.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,429
Phil: So you’ll learn the principles of
networks as well as how the Internet works

5
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,380
and why. So Nick, why should students take
this class?

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,320
ニck: Well, first off, the Internet was invented
here at Stanford! Well, partially invented

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,140
here – many people contributed a lot. And
it’s the greatest invention of our times.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:32,140
You’re watching this video over the Internet.
And I don’t think its growth in importance

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,580
is slowing down. In ten years it’s going
to be even more important.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:44,460
Phil: I totally agree! The Internet today
is more than just Facebook. It’s changing

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,340
main street in small towns, as services like
Amazon grow. It’s changing politics through

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:56,340
services like Twitter and events such the
Arab Spring. It’s changing education through

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:05,210
videos like this. It is transforming society,
and it’s exciting to live through that transformation.

14
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:15,799
We grew up just as the Internet was starting
to take off – I still remember the first

15
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:22,799
time I used a web browser in 1995, the summer
before I went to college. I realized the world

16
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:29,639
was going to change. I just didn’t know
by how much.

17
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:36,639
Nick: We’re teaching the class using a flipped
classroom. The reference material is in videos

18
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:45,929
such as this one, which we’ve recorded and
you’ll watch before class. The class meets

19
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:55,060
three times a week. Once a week, on Mondays,
we’ll have an in-class exercise, such as

20
00:01:56,389 --> 00:02:01,469
using a software tool to map out Stanford’s
network. On Wednesdays we have guest lectures,

21
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,999
including one from David Clark, the Chief
Protocol Architect of the Internet when it

22
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:12,739
was first designed in the 1970s, as well as
lectures from Netflix, a member of the Internet

23
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:14,430
Architecture Board, Google, and more.

24
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:21,430
Phil: These lectures will give you examples
of how the principles and ideas you’re learning

25
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:30,239
in the class are applied outside of academia.
They’ll also introduce a lot of interesting

26
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,799
problems and challenges the Internet and its
users face today.

27
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:42,799
Phil: On Fridays, we split the class in two
so Nick and I can hold section meetings to

28
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,340
get to know you better. We’ll alternate
which half of the class we meet with so you’ll

29
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:55,340
see each of us five times. We’re using section
as an opportunity to ask and discuss some

30
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,840
open ended questions about the Internet. For
example, in one section I’ll present how

31
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,360
BitCoin works to start a discussion on its
technical, economic, legal, and political

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,310
implications.

33
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:18,310
Nick: The in-class exercises on Monday and
guest lectures on Wednesday are required.

34
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,719
The Friday section is optional.

35
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:30,719
Nick: Phil and I both enjoy teaching this
class because we both research networked systems

36
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,599
and so spend a lot of time thinking about
them. We enjoy teaching new students each

37
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:48,040
year about them, and hope that some of our
enthusiasm and excitement can rub off!
