Here’s a quiz. For this quiz, assume there
is no other

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,040
documentation of the TCP finite state machine,
so there’s no

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,679
supporting textual description which defines
other state

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,959
transitions.
In the first question, suppose the finite

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:18,580
state machine starts
in the closed state. Then a user program calls

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,900
listen on the
socket. The socket receives a SYN message,

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,140
but before any
other event arrives the user program calls

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,990
closed. What state
will the socket be in?

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,849
In the second question, suppose the finite
state machine

10
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:35,239
starts in the closed state. Then a user program
calls connect

11
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,870
and before any other event arrives the user
program calls

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,350
close. What state will the socket be in?
