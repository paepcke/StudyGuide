1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,949
So in this unit where going to finally dig down below IP

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:07,129
and answer the question what is a link and

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:11,929
how they work. So, how does the link layer
work and what are issues that you encounter at the link layer.

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:15,308
So there are two basic things that this unit is going to cover.

5
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:18,990
The first: the fundamental principles of
communication

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,880
this is where the boundary of computer
science and networking with electrical

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,550
engineering

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,730
we're going to talk about things like signal
and noise

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,720
and how the signal to noise ratio, in fact,
determines what's the potential

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,149
bit rate capacity of a link. There's a
reason why today we don't have

11
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:37,799
100 terabit per second link layers
because of some of these

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,719
fundamental mathematical principles of
communication. So based on that, we're

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:42,670
going to look at things like

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,640
bit errors and how link layers recover from them.
Using coding,

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,860
Error correcting codes. So that 
for example, you add a little bit of redundancy to your link layer frames

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,870
such that, if there are a few bit errors down at the physical and link layer,

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,100
you can recover from and still
receive the frame correctly. So the second thing

18
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,890
that we're going to learn about it this

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,010
in this unit are how these links are
actually built. You'll remember

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,240
from unit one that the

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,540
thin waste of IP allows many many physical layers

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,010
and link layers to operate underneath and still
use the

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,520
Interne Protocol and to tie them all together. So there are different categories of

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,130
physical links we're going to be talking
about two here, two that you'll be very

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:23,759
familiar with

26
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,790
already. There's wired links, for which the

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,850
dominant linking in use today is ethernet. So we'll learn

28
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,270
how ethernet works. The original version
Ethernet used a shared

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,579
cable and so needed a way to share
that cable

30
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:40,040
so we'll be learning about what's called the
CMSA/CD protocol

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,500
and medium access control mechanism  that allows us to share that physical cable.

32
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,840
but we'll learn also how ethernet works today,

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,399
which is to use switches, which you learned a  little bit about already

34
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,840
In the previous unit, how they learn addresses and

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,719
tables get populated. The second thing we'll be learning

36
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,189
under the links is wireless links. Now wireless is quite different

37
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,759
from wired. more than just a the fact
that it's broadcasted

38
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,179
into the air, there's many characteristics of wireless that make it fundamentally

39
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,760
different in the way that it works and we need to be mindful of these when making practical links

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,819
the first thing is

41
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:20,340
the signal itself and the channel can vary

42
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,900
it's not fixed over time
like it is in a wired link

43
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,940
where it always has the same capacity operating on the same link

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,989
The channel can fade, there can be

45
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:33,260
different types of interference signals can take different paths with different links

46
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,430
and interfere with itself and because it's broadcast

47
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,790
everybody can hear and so this introduces challenges as well

48
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,470
as well security challenges because
everybody can hear what we're saying

49
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,860
there's another problem that we'll learn about that's called the hidden terminal problem

50
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,120
this is when two clients that are communicating

51
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,970
Are both happily talking to an AP 
you but they have no means to

52
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,810
communicate with each other

53
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,050
because they don't have any direct signal contact

54
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,739
there needs to be some extra level of
coordination in the network to make sure

55
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:06,709
that they don't interfere

56
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:12,800
with each other or at the access point. In addition to
learning about these different types

57
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,310
link we'll be learning about what are
the consequences of having

58
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,629
these different links and that is that different links can carry packets up to a different

59
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:20,810
maximum size

60
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,209
so-called maximum transmission unit. ethernet for
example

61
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,250
take packets up to 1500 bytes low other links
may take

62
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,319
packets only upto a certain length and so you
probably remember that mention IP

63
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,519
fragmentation

64
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,989
in the earlier parts of the class. This is necessary when you're
going from a link with a

65
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,500
large maximum transmission unit down to  a small one

66
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,890
that is not able to carry it the network will
fragment it

67
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,760
into a number of self contained fragmets that don't get put back together again

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,170
until they get to the end host which then reassembles the data and

69
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,629
hands it up to the next layer. so you learn how that works

70
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:01,000
what specific mechanisms are inside  IP to make that work.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,939
The last thing we're going to be learning about is this really interesting tricky little detail

72
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,450
of the communication channel and that is that
when two hosts or two

73
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,000
ends of a link are communicating with each other they can't
possibly be using exactly the same

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,139
clock or have exactly the same frequency
exactly the same phase

75
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,610
two different places at the same
time so when a  sender is sending using one clock

76
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,590
which is potentially different from the one the 
receiver is using. So,  somehow we need to

77
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,690
indicate to  the receiver what clock
rate and

78
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,479
frequency and phase that we were using in order for the far end to correctly decode the data

79
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,380
so we'll learn about encoding inorder to
recover the clock

80
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,979
and use it correctly at the far end
