00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,720
Let’s look at a worked example for delay
guarantees.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,720
Q. Two end hosts are separated by three routers
and four 250km links running at 100Mb/s. The

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,020
end hosts want to send a flow of 1500byte
packets to each other at 15Mb/s, but they

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,869
don’t want their packets to take more than
10ms to go from end-to-end. If each router

5
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:32,869
serves the flow at 15Mb/s, how long will packets
be delayed in each router? (Assume a propagation

6
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:40,850
speed of 2x108 m/s and that queueing delay
is evenly distributed among the routers.)

7
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:46,350
From the question we know that a third of
the queueing delay will be in each of the

8
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,429
routers. So first, we need to figure out what
the queueing delay is. The queueing delay

9
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:57,579
will be the total delay, which is 10ms, minus
the fixed delay, which is the sum of the packetization

10
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,999
delay and the propagation delay.

11
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:06,180
Let’s first calculate the packetization
delay, which is the time to transmit a 1500byte

12
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,290
packet onto each of the four links along the
path. For each link, the packetization delay

13
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:19,290
is 1500bytes * 8bits/byte divided by 100Mb/s
or 10 to the power of 8. This gives us a total

14
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,820
packetization delay of 0.48ms.

15
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:31,660
Now let’s calculate the propagation delay,
which is the time taken for one bit to traverse

16
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:38,660
all four links. The time for each link is
250km times 1000m per km, divided by the speed

17
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,100
of propagation. The total time will be 5ms
across all four links. Our total fixed delay

18
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:55,100
is therefore 5.48ms. This means the queueing
delay is 10 – 5.48ms = 4.52ms, which we

19
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,020
are told is divided equally among the three
routers. Therefore, the queueing delay in

20
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:11,020
each router can be no more than 1.507ms. The
answer is therefore 1.507ms of delay per router.

21
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,819
We could go on and calculate the amount of
buffering needed in each router to hold 1.507ms

22
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:28,819
of data. Given that the queue is being served
at 15Mb/s, this corresponds to 1.507ms * 15Mb/s

23
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,280
= 22,605 bits. In practice, we’d round this
up to at least two packets, which is 24,000

24
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:43,269
bits per router.
