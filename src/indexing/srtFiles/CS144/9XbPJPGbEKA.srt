Hereâ€™s a quiz. Suppose I decide I want to
make Blowfish faster, and so cut it to just

2
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:13,049
one iteration. I feed it two plaintext blocks.
The first plaintext block is all zeroes, which

3
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:20,049
my adversary somehow knows. It produces the
first ciphertext. I feed it a second plaintext

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,250
block, which produces the second ciphertext.
What is the value of L0 in the second plaintext

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,750
block?
