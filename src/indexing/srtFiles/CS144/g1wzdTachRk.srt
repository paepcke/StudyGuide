1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,669
Nick: By now you’ve heard it said several
times during the quarter that IP is the “narrow

2
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:09,070
waist” of the Internet. You probably remember
this figure from Unit 1….

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,949
Nick: If we want to use the Internet, we have
to use the Internet Protocol, IP. We have

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,950
no choice.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,239
But we have lots and lots of choices for Link
Layers: IP runs over many different Link Layers,

6
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:26,029
such as Ethernet, WiFi, DSL, 3G cellular,
and so on. On top of the unreliable IP layer,

7
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:28,419
we can choose between many different transport
layers . We already saw TCP and UDP. There

8
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:29,109
is RTP for real time data and many others
too. And of course there are tens of thousands

9
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,359
of different applications. .

10
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:33,769
In this unit you learned about different link
layers. You learned about the Link Layer Service

11
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:38,260
Model, how Etherhet works, incuding the different
speeds it runs at. You watched several videos

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,440
about wireless networks: Why wireless is different
and why we need medium access control protocols

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,120
to share access to the air. You learned about
Shannon capacity and how it helps us determine

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,410
the maximum data rate, or capacity, of a communication
channel. And you learned about error correction

15
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,519
mechanisms.

16
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:58,288
Phil: We started by exploring the most commonly
used wired network: Ethernet. If you’ve

17
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,890
ever physically plugged your computer into
a network, it was almost certainly an Ethernet

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,579
network. Although many different wired networks
were proposed in 1990s, and several were standardized,

19
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:13,100
built and sold, Ethernet won the day and is
now almost universally used for wired networks.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:19,020
This is because it is very simple, cheap and
reliable. In a switched Ethernet network,

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,570
when you have data to send, you can just go
ahead and send it. The network learns addresses,

22
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,450
so there are no complicated routing protocols
to worry about. And Ethernet runs over the

23
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,990
wiring that is installed in almost every office
building – making it very easy to install.

24
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,700
Nowadays, almost all Ethernet networks use
Ethernet switches, allowing many simultaneous

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,310
communications in the network, and every link
is full duplex, allowing data to flow in both

26
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:48,299
directions at the same time. In the next few
years we will start to see 40Gb/s Ethernet,

27
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,960
100Gb/s Ethernet and beyond. Ethernet looks
certain to remain the dominant wired link

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,270
layer for years to come.

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:03,219
All link layer networks have a maximum packet
size they can carry. For Ethernet, this is

30
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:08,840
1500bytes by default. Other link layers can
carry larger packets, such as the FDDI standard

31
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,780
of the 1990s that carried packets up to 4500bytes
long. Some Ethernet networks are configured

32
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,330
to carry so-called Jumbo frames up to 9kbtyes
long. We call the longest packet a link can

33
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,700
carry its “MTU”, or maximum transmission
unit. When a router interconnects two links

34
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,340
with different MTUs, it might need to fragment
IP datagrams going from the link with the

35
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,190
larger MTU to the smaller one. You learned
how a router does this using the fragment

36
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:45,190
fields in the IPv4 header to break IP datagrams
into new self-contained IP datagrams. The

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,210
network doesn’t reassemble the fragments;
the destination host uses information in the

38
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:57,210
IPv4 header to put the data back into the
correct order before handing it to TCP. IP

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,740
fragmentation is less common than it used
to be, for two reasons. First, most wired

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,420
networks use Ethernet today, and so the MTU
tends to be 1500bytes on most links and there

41
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,840
is no need to fragment. Second, hosts often
use MTU discovery when creating a TCP connection,

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,740
to identify the shortest MTU along the path.
The senders don’t send packets larger than

43
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:26,560
the MTU, eliminating the need for fragmentation
along the way. When we talk about the MSS,

44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,130
or maximum segment size, of a transport protocol,
it’s the smallest MTU along a path between

45
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,380
the IP endpoints.

46
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,110
Wireless networks are very different from
wired networks. In a wired network the links

47
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,650
have a constant data rate, but in a wireless
network the link speed is always changing.

48
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,690
This is for several reasons: interference
from nearby wireless networks, and from other

49
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,340
devices operating in the same frequency band,
such as microwave ovens and cordless phones.

50
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,570
It can also be caused by fades in the channel
due to shadowing and multipath. Wireless networks

51
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,930
also suffer from the so-called hidden terminal
problem; this happens when two clients can’t

52
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,850
communicate directly with each other, but
can both communicate with an access point.

53
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,400
Because they don’t hear each other, they
don’t know to avoid transmitting at the

54
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,259
same time, requiring extra coordination in
the network. Another way in which wireless

55
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:21,870
networks are different is that the channel
naturally broadcasts all communications. This

56
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:27,189
means senders need to take turns to transmit,
leading to medium access control protocols,

57
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:32,789
such as the CSMA protocol used in WiFi. A
shared broadcast channel also means we need

58
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:37,080
to be more careful with securing our data
– everyone in the neighborhood can more

59
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,770
easily eavesdrop on our conversations than
in a wired network.

60
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,349
Nick: You also learned some of the underlying
principles of communications that dictate

61
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:48,250
how we build physical links.

62
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,020
You learned about bit errors and how they
can lead us to incorrectly decode a packet

63
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,370
on the wire; and you learn about ways to code
data to make it easier to detect errors when

64
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,960
they happen.

65
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,740
And you learned about how error correcting
codes work, and when we use them. Generally

66
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,770
speaking, we use error correcting codes in
environments where bit errors are frequent,

67
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,210
or where the cost of retransmitting a corrupted
packet would be high: for example, in a network

68
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,139
with a very large bandwidth-delay product.

69
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,759
Finally, but perhaps most importantly of all,
you learned about Shannon capacity. Claude

70
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,189
Shannon created the wonderfully powerful field
of information theory, and the centerpiece

71
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:32,310
of his work was deducing the maximum errror-free
rate that a channel can communicate at, now

72
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,310
referred to as the Shannon capacity. The remarkable
property of the Shannon capacity is that it

73
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,430
gives a fundamental, inescapable limit to
the maximum rate information can be carried

74
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:50,020
over a channel, regardless of the clever coding
schemes we invent.

75
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,669
All of the communications principles we describe
give you a taste of some of the material you

76
00:05:54,669 --> 00:06:00,449
would learn in an electrical engineering class
on communications theory or information theory.

77
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:04,580
If you really enjoyed this material, you might
consider taking EE classes in future.
