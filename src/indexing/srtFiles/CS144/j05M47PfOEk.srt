00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:07,290
In this video I will provide a worked example
for a single flow with AIMD congestion control.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:13,209
Alice is streaming a high definition video
at 10Mb/s from a remote server in San Francisco.

3
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:18,230
All packets are 250bytes long. She measures
the ping time to the server and the minimum

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:24,860
time she measures is 5ms. Once the AIMD window
reaches steady state, for the rest of the

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,910
video, the sawtooth oscillates between constant
minimum and maximum values. The buffer is

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,440
perfectly sized so that it is just big enough
to never go empty.

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,370
1. What is the smallest value of the AIMD
window (in bytes)?

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,280
The minimum ping time of 5ms is when the buffer
is empty but the bottleneck link is full.

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,190
At 10Mb/s, there is therefore 50,000 bits
in the “pipe”.

10
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,190
This means the minimum or “trough” of
the AIMD sawtooth is 50,000 bits, or 6250

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,210
bytes. So therefore the answer is 6250 bytes.

12
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,430
Part 2.

13
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,700
What is the largest value of the AIMD window
in bytes?

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:16,700
When the buffer is full, the RTT is doubled
from 5ms to 10ms.

15
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:23,999
At 10Mb/s, the maximum RTT will hold 100,000
bits. 50,000bits are in flight, and 50,000

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,609
bits are in the buffer.
Therefore the maximum or “peak” of the

17
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:34,630
AIMD sawtooth is 100,000 bits or 12,500 bytes.

18
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,099
Part 3.

19
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:40,479
How big is the packet buffer in the router
in bytes?

20
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:47,479
We already decided in Q2 that when full, the
buffer holds one minimum RTT, or 50,000 bits.

21
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:56,169
After a packet is dropped, how long does it
take for the window to reach its maximum value

22
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:56,899
again?

23
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:58,380
Part 4.

24
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,929
Packets are 2,000 bits long and so the window
will increase by 2,000 bits every RTT.

25
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:10,929
Therefore, it takes 25 RTTs to increase the
RTT by 50,000 bits and fill the buffer.

26
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:18,140
The average RTT is 7.5ms, therefore it will
take 187.5ms.

27
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,200
Part 5.

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,200
If Alice now tries to watch the same video
from a server in Australia (with RTT 250ms),

29
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,780
how big should the router buffer be (in bytes)
if the network still runs at 10Mb/s?

30
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:42,780
The minimum RTT is 250ms, so the buffer needs
to be at least 250ms * 10Mb/s = 2.5 x 10^6

31
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,260
bits.
Because we express storage in powers of 2,

32
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:58,260
the answer is 2.4Mbits or 298 Kbytes.

33
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,530
Part 6.

34
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,790
When the server is in Australia, after a packet
is dropped, how long does it take for the

35
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,260
window to reach its maximum value again (in
seconds)?

36
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,460
As before, the window increases by 2,000 bits
every round.

37
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:21,460
To fill the buffer will take 2.5 x 10^6 / 2
x 10^3 = 1,250 rounds.

38
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,040
The average RTT is 375ms.
So the time to reach the maximum again is

39
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:37,790
468.75 seconds, or almost 8 minutes!

40
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,840
The answer might surprise you. It takes a
long time for the AIMD flow to recover from

41
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,590
a single packet drop. This would be a real
problem in practice, which motivates us to

42
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,099
look for better and quicker ways for TCP to
recover from dropped packets.
