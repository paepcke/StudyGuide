00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,169
The answer to the first question is FIN WAIT
1. Letâ€™s walk

2
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:09,309
through why. We start in the closed state.
Then the user

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:14,360
program calls listen. We transition to the
LISTEN state. Then

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,640
the socket receives a SYN and we transition
to the SYN

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,020
RECEIVED state. While in the SYN RECEIVED
state the user

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,400
program calls close. So we traverse the edge
with close() as

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,390
an event, to the FIN WAIT 1 state.
