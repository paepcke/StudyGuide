00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:04,110
Nick: In this unit you will learn a lot about
packet switching – it is quite an intense

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,020
unit and your head might be spinning with
packets by the end of it. But that’s why

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,700
we have videos! You can cover the material
at your own pace and review it several times.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,360
Phil: We will start out with a leisurely look
at why the Internet – and almost all modern

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,780
networks – are built on a foundation of
packet switching. Packet switching is simple

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,560
in the sense that each packet is a self-contained
unit of data that carries information necessary

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,809
for it to reach its destination. Packet switching
is efficient in the sense that it keeps a

8
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:40,679
link busy whenever there is work to be done,
rather than have dedicated capacity reserved

9
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,350
for each user or application.

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,069
Nick: After a leisurely introduction to packet
switching, we will dive deeply into some of

11
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:51,338
the consequences. We will take a journey that
includes more math than you will see in any

12
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:56,460
other unit of this course. The math might
seem daunting at first, but it’s actually

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,299
quite simple. Once you learn the math, so
many other details or complex questions become

14
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:06,310
really easy to answer and understand. For
example, you will learn why two packets traveling

15
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:12,170
between the same two end hosts might encounter
a different delay. While the time they spend

16
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,969
traversing each link is the same, the packets
might take different paths and experience

17
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:18,189
different queueing delays in the router buffers.

18
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:24,590
Phil: Make sure you fully understand the three
main components of packet delay: the packetization

19
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:30,609
delay, the propagation delay, and the queueing
delay; and that you understand the physical

20
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:35,140
processes that cause them. By the end of this
unit you will be able to answer questions

21
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,380
like: “How long does it take for a packet
to get from here to London?” or “How many

22
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,359
packets can I fit in space between the moon
and Mars?”. You’ll understand why routers

23
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,490
have buffers, and how queueing delay leads
to uncertainty about when packets will arrive.

24
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,289
For most applications, this isn’t an issue.
But for real time streaming applications,

25
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:59,770
like Skype and YouTube, they need to playback
smooth, hiccup-free audio and video to the

26
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,359
user, and so they need to absorb the variation
in delay across the Internet. You’ll learn

27
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,789
how playback buffers are designed.

28
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:12,470
Nick: Finally, you’ll learn about how packet
switches work in practice. At the end of the

29
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,170
unit you’ll also be able to answer the question:
“How does an Internet router actually work?”,

30
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,250
and “How is it different from an Ethernet
switch?”. “How does a router arrange its

31
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,200
lookup tables?” and so on. It’s quite
a whistle-stop tour of packet switching, and

32
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,810
by the end of the unit you should have a good
intuition for how packet switching works in

33
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,170
the Internet.
