1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:06,400
The answer is that it will take at most 2
to the 368 attempts. The two random values

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,910
are known by an adversary, because they are
sent plaintext. The one true secret is the

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,560
pre-master secret, which is 46 bits long.
If the adversary can guess this value, then

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,410
it can recompute the master secret using the
pseudo-random function. With the master secret,

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,669
it can recompute the keys.
