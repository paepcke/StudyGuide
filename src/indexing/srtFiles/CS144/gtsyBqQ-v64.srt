1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,770
>> Phil: So Here I am with Jon Peterson Who's
an old friend of mine and kind of an important

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,809
person in the internet.

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:16,809
Maybe you 
should start with how did you get involved

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,660
>> Jon: That's a good question I Lucky enough
to be around with the dot com boom in the

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,180
late 1990's

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,140
When the small startup that I worked for in
boston was acquired by level 3 communications,

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,010
they moved me out to scenic boulder colorado.

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,870
Uh where phil actually was as well at roughly
the same time. And Level 3 is of course one

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,410
of the tier one, backbone providers of the
internet,

10
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,100
and they have a profound engagement with the
internet engineering task force, one of the

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,730
standards bodies that helped make the internet,
that defined how the internet works.

12
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,800
And when I got there, that was one of the
things that most attracted me about this oppurtinity.

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,059
Would be the ability to really work with the
top minds that were out there.

14
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,900
So I started attending the IETF. I had been
on mailing lists amd things like that before

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,360
hand but I first started attending when I
worked at level 3.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:21,360
I just found it to be a fascinating community,
that had such intellectual rigor, that had

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:28,480
so much interest in trying to find the right
solution. You don't go to the IETF and represent

18
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,650
a company, you go there and you put forward
what you think is the best idea.

19
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:39,310
And it is a place where there really is a
meritocracy of ideas. Once you get the [inaudible]

20
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,290
you discover there are all of these other
dimensions to internet governance.

21
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,860
If you are there at the IETF, you may end
up dealing with the W3C if you work on application

22
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,580
because they have responsibility for the standards
associated with the world wide web.

23
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:58,580
You may end up working with ICANN, people
that do domain name assignments. And I kind

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,360
of made the rounds of these interenet governance
circles and working on the intersection between

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,080
technology and public policy, tends to take
you to some pretty interesting places.

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,030
>> Phil: Well, so the first work that you
did was SIP -- the session initiation protocol.

27
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,980
Do you want to talk about this IP telephony
and kind of what this path was to where SIP

28
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,040
is today and what your part in it was?

29
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,749
>> Jon: Sure, it's important to remember that
in the early 1990's, there really wasn't anything

30
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:30,700
like voice over ip, not really.
There was some experimental technologies that

31
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,159
people had rigged up and ran on some of the
unix environments in labs in California,

32
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,129
but there was no commerical product that you
could buy that would let you talk to someone

33
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:41,340
over the internet.

34
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,749
Remember as well that in the mid 1990's you
know a lot of computer's didn't have adequate

35
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:51,310
sound cards, there certainly wasn't adequate
video capture.

36
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:58,209
Network interfaces were spotty at best and
the actual commercial service that you could

37
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:04,420
purchase at the consumer level were -- to
get enough bandwidth to communicate for something

38
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,689
like voice over IP didn't exist.

39
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,799
Sometime around 1996, 1997 we hit a sweet
spot where the computing power was there,

40
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,779
the network was there, computers tended to
have the right interfaces to do this so we

41
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:21,150
started to see the first voice over IP offerings
around that time.

42
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:28,060
When I started working on this around 1997,
I worked on the infrastructure dimension of

43
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,989
this. The startup that I worked for in boston
was focussed on the particular problem of

44
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:37,439
how you could take a traditional telephone
switch and these telephone switches made by

45
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:44,310
nortell and eusend, they were more of these
expensive, monolithic, special purpose devices

46
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,099
that required a ton of operational oversite.

47
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:53,999
They didn't really fit into the internet software
model or the internet disruptive innovation

48
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:57,620
that we all associate with technology today.

49
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,669
So I was one of the first people to work on
something called soft switching. The idea

50
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:07,459
that you could take a general purpose computer,
take a solaris box a unix box and put the

51
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:13,099
control plane logic for a telephone switch
on a box like that and just have it control

52
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,729
telephone circuits, just literally switching
from one customer from another.

53
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:24,729
To handle those instead of dumb devices. And
this created an extremely disruptive influence

54
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,919
on the telephone switch market and today,
I think it's safe to say, that it has become

55
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,729
dominant, that you can't really buy things
like these nortell switches anymore except

56
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,490
on the secondary market.
You own one today and you need replacement

57
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:46,479
parts for one, you pretty much have to get
them on E-Bay

58
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,690
Once you build a soft switch, now naturally
some of these unix boxes have internet access

59
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,840
then you need ways for these switches to talk
to one another to be able to coordinate calls

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,720
that don't use the outdated x25 based ss7
systems that are used in the traditional telephone

61
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,090
network.

62
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,409
And thats where tools like SIP started to
come into play.

63
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:13,699
A lot of my early work on the Session Initiation
Protocol was on telephony replacement, was

64
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:20,110
on how you would not touch that traditional
network but how you would instead do all of

65
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,349
this over the internet, how you would set
up calls at the end and um this started to

66
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:29,650
be an important dimension of adopting Voice
over IP Protocols.

67
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,960
It's one thing to build a tool that lets you
talk to anybody else who happens to have a

68
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,030
good computer, right in the 1990's when people
didn't have the technology that you have.

69
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,750
It was a very different matter to actually
call someone on the telphone network.

70
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,729
And these soft switched became bridges between
people in the traditional network and people

71
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:48,930
in the VOIP space.

72
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,430
But these have been essential going forward
to how VOIP has become successful, to the

73
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,360
ability for programs like, say, skype today,
to be able to call out from your PC to someone

74
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,750
who has a normal ground line [inaudible] phone.

75
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,500
>> PHIL: and so one of the things that you
worked on in sort of the more refined versions

76
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,520
of SIP was sort of it's security model. How
do you actually secure the signal in the protocol.

77
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,280
So as I'm sure you can imagine given some
of the recent events in uh the internet with

78
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,129
respect to the Snowden releases.

79
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:26,560
This is kind of an interesting question, do
you see something about the implications of

80
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,500
stuff like SIP and security with resoect to
then like PSTN, wiretapping laws, those sorts

81
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,289
of questions? Where do you think this is going
or how is it different?

82
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:40,509
>> Jon: [laugh] Big question. Yeah so I do
recall that when we were building the RFC

83
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:45,069
for SIP, RFC3261 we basically drew straws
for who was going to draw straws for who was

84
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:50,319
going to do what parts and I got to do the
review of how SIP operated with a one paragraph

85
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:50,930
statement

86
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:57,469
I got to do adressing, I got to do user behavior
and then I drew the straw to do security.

87
00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:03,280
And I said OK I have a security background
this shouldn't be too difficult and the initial

88
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,330
planned one section on security in SIP actually
ended up being 4 chapters of the RFC

89
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:15,330
At the time this was the largest RFC ever
published and SIP Security has always been

90
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:23,969
a problem child. And um these revelations
obviously put the ietf and people who develop

91
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,270
standards in a very interesting position.

92
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,189
You know no less of an authority than Bruce
Snyder who is one of the greatest minds today

93
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:39,580
thinking about security has formally called
on the ietf to drop what it's doing and to

94
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:45,439
refocus all of its efforts in our upcoming
meeting which will be in vancouver on how

95
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,710
we are going to resolve the problems that
have been raised by prism.

96
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:57,409
And we studied the privacy properties of these
protocols, the security properties of these

97
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:01,840
protocols very extensively.

98
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:08,840
I'm as convinced now as I ever was that we
made a lot of compromises in the SIP security

99
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,240
becuase they were necessary for it to be adopted
in the marketplace.

100
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,030
It'd be great to design protocol that had
built-in security that can guarantee integrity

101
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:26,150
and confidentiallity between one end point
that is trying to make a call and another

102
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,740
endpoint that is trying to make a call.

103
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,330
As soon as some intermediaries are playing
some role in the delivery of that. As soon

104
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:36,389
as something needs to help you to find the
right endpoint, and this dynamic capability

105
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:42,860
that SIP has to allow you to -- you know if
I wanted to have five devices that were to

106
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,769
my SIP name: a deskphone my cell phone an
iPad, various other devices, They all need

107
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:54,600
to connect to some server somewhere that will
be responsible for routing traffic to them.

108
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,760
The degree to which that server has access
to signalling, has access to who's calling

109
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,310
me, what are the media streams that are going
to be set up and what are the IP endpoints

110
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,050
that the media is going to be sent between.

111
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:16,050
We could have done more to protect that with
the design of SIP. And I think if we had,

112
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,410
we wouldn't be talking about SIP right now
because it wouldn't have succeeded enough

113
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,970
for it to even be noteworthy.

114
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:28,470
>> Phil: so, Can you talk about, so Sip Might
be a protocol that most people don't realize

115
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,600
they are using or about where it is being
used. Do you want to talk a little about where

116
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,009
it has been succesful and where it has been
adopted?

117
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:39,639
>> Jon: Sure. So I mentioned Skype, you do
Skype in or Skype out, Skype's internal protocol

118
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:46,639
is converted into SIP for transfer to a gateway
and then go to the telephone network.

119
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:54,029
Um basically, if you use a VOIP service for
a land line in your house, that comes from

120
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,990
either FiOS or a cable provider that, surely
SIP is going to be used in the background.

121
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:07,899
The third generation cell phones, things that
are 3g pt based all use SIP inside them.

122
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:13,870
Now these networks, especially we talk about
mobile phones and about the networks we see

123
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:20,010
and the cable NSOs and so on, they use a version
of SIP that is relatively archetecturally

124
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,290
similar to the telphone network.

125
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,019
They in fact applied the protocol machinery
of SIP to generate a system that has many

126
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:31,430
of the same properties that the telephone
network has. And this too is a fundamental

127
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,130
tradeoff -- the design of these things.

128
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:40,130
I would love to see a SIP that was much less
dependent on the network elements shaping

129
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,800
traffic and deciding based on that. If it
were much more driven by the end points.

130
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,660
This is just kind of the fundamental end to
end principle of the internet. That you want

131
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,060
to have the smarts be at the end points. You
don't want to have an intermediary have to

132
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,420
understand what the end points want to do.

133
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,240
It shouldn't get in their way, it shouldn't
prevent them from negotiating. In fact, If

134
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,970
I made up a great new codec tomorrow and I
have copy and you have a copy that sits on

135
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,149
our two machines, I don't want that thing
in the middle of the network to have to know

136
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:14,040
anything about that codec for us to connect
and use it.

137
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,870
The realities though of how these things actually
get implemented, especially when you are doing

138
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,410
something as complex as the act of replacing
the telephone network.

139
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,399
Replacing a more than a century old system
with its reliability constraints with its

140
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,949
emergency services implications. So where
you go when you call 911

141
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:38,949
Just getting the basic services you associate
with this right. It requires you to make compromises

142
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:45,190
and I can't say that I'm always proud in retrospect
of the compromises we needed to make for the

143
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,199
protocol to be successful.

144
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:52,300
But, I do acknowledge in retrospect that if
we had pushed back on some of those compromises,

145
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,420
it certainly would have led to the death of
the protocol. As people who design standards,

146
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,449
this is a heart breaking thing. That you come
up against time and time again.

147
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:08,449
Now, we can be smarter about this and I think
that if there is a silver lining to these

148
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,480
increasingly disturbing revelations that are
coming out about widespread surveillance in

149
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,540
the Internet. It might create the political
veil to see a change in what we can get consensus

150
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,070
for and, hopefully, what we can get people
to be willing to deploy.

151
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,839
You now I believe that when you go to the
IETF and it is consensus based, there are

152
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,740
things that we can get consensus to do that
I think would be very radical at this point.

153
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,699
Because the people that go to the IETF are
so well informed are so energized are so interested

154
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:39,329
in individual liberties.

155
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:43,610
I would hate to see the IETF, though, to become
an organization that is developing standards

156
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,610
that never see the light of day, because it
has swung to far in this direction. So it

157
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,130
is very difficult for us to understand what
the right direction is, for us to chart at

158
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:53,759
this point.

159
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,079
>> Phil: Interesting. So I'd like to wind
back a little bit and where how you mentioned

160
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:05,339
sort of building the first soft switch and
how all the logic was in a general purpose

161
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:12,199
computer then in I guess a Sun box. Do you
see sort of a parallel between that and software

162
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:16,089
defined networking today? Where we see that
sort of transition maybe happening in the

163
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,410
internet? And some of the methods currently
behind SDN?

164
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,290
>> Jon: I certainly see many parallels. I'm
not sure those parallels will play out exactly

165
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:31,220
the way because companies like Cisco and Juniper
would not stand to be disrupted by this the

166
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,459
same way that Nortel and Eusend were in the
90's.

167
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:40,420
They are more agile companies, they are companies
that are taking these technologies and trying

168
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:47,420
to figure out a middle path. For instance
the is the I2RS the interface to the routing

169
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:51,829
system, a standard proposal circulating in
the IETF now.

170
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:55,750
It's very different from the very low layer
software defined networking approach that

171
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:02,750
we see in say the open networking foundation,
but it is nonetheless a way that software

172
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:09,410
can interact with it and help higher level
routing decisions get made.

173
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:16,410
I think the routing vendors view this as one
tool among many that will help decide how

174
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:18,529
packets are going to be forwarded.

175
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:22,680
They are figuring out ways in other words
to subsume this.

176
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,040
That will allow their device to take advantage
of the strengths of this but without necessarily

177
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,699
a road in the market control. And the lengthy
install base that they have of the maintenance

178
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:39,399
tools and so on that have proven so successful
to the internet in the past.

179
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:46,399
I don't know that core routers have that to
the degree that old telephone switches did

180
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:53,209
that impeded innovation in the network. And
that was another real driver for soft switching

181
00:14:53,209 --> 00:15:00,209
was that these telephone switches were so
[inaudible] that that had no programability,

182
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:06,410
they had no sophisticated interfaces that
you could use to modify their behavior without

183
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,569
doing open heart surgery.

184
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:15,569
The situation is very different for core routers
but the parallels, they do stand. I wouldn't

185
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:21,560
dismiss it out of hand and I certainly know
people who work for major router vendors who,

186
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,730
if you find them at the bar at the right hour,
will cry on your shoulder about exactly their

187
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,600
concerns about this.

188
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,209
It is a real challenge for that business.

189
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:35,980
>> Phil: If you were to look at all the different
pieces of work, so how many working groups

190
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,290
are in the ietf today?

191
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,750
>> Jon: Off the top of my head I'm not sure
I could say. Order of 100

192
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:49,579
>> Phil: If you were to think what's something
you'd suggest to somebody, "Hey this is something

193
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:51,940
you should keep your eye on. This is something
that I think is some of the most interesting

194
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,500
work going on in the internet." So stuff which
is currently in progress and really might

195
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,480
significantly change what the network is like
in three or so years. Where would you suggest

196
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:02,829
looking?

197
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:08,970
>> Jon: Well actually that I2RS group is something
that is very interesting right now.

198
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,060
There is a new effort that has just been spotted
that's unclear if it's going to be a working

199
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:19,639
group or not, it's called per-pass, which
is the IETF's forum for discussing prism.

200
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:22,670
For discussing how these security things could
be addressed.

201
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,329
There are already some proposals that are
circulating there that are really about structural

202
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:34,329
changes about how the ICANN process would
work. Should standards be the new bar to obviate

203
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,329
the increasingly very real concerns that are
coming to light about all of this.

204
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:46,959
If you were coming to Vancouver this time,
these are certainly things I'd point you to.

205
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,410
There are things that I happen to be working
on That I think are very interesting and pratical

206
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:58,410
that might not extend to exactly that level
but I continue to be very interested in CDNs

207
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:05,260
and the degree of traffic that is now being
directed by content distribution networks.

208
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,569
We're doing a lot of work today on understanding
intefaces for how CDNs express their coverage

209
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:18,569
areas, how CDNs can advertise services that
they provide, in order to allow collaboration

210
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:26,309
or peering among CDNs. To make more optimal
selections among CDNs.

211
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:31,520
I think this will have potentially tremendous
impact on the efficiency of internet traffic.

212
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,270
It will alleviate some of the bottlenecks
with more and more video and content in the

213
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,870
internet. That's a personal pet project of
mine.

214
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,900
And I'm also still working on somethings at
the intersection of the Telephone network

215
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:52,900
and the internet. One thing that's been a
major issue, you know robo-calling has become

216
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,220
an increasing problem as the internet and
the telphone network have become more and

217
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,240
more interconnected.

218
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:08,240
And right now I'm looking at how we can do
better identity services, so it is harder

219
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,919
to spoof calls, so it's easier to figure out
who is responsible for a telephone call that

220
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:16,970
is coming off of the internet before it hits
the PSDN as the numbers for this are just

221
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,780
going up and up.

222
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:24,010
The FTC and the FCC are profoundly interested
in finding a solution for this. This is being

223
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:29,270
discussed in congressional subcommitees already
as it is going on in the IETF so I think that

224
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,429
is a place where we can really make a difference.

225
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:34,659
And it is something that is hurting consumers
and it's something that will be a big deal

226
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:35,330
going forward.

227
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,510
>> PHIL: So if we stop receiving robo-calls,
we have you to thank?

228
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,490
Great well thanks for stopping by, thanks
for your time and...

229
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,200
>> Jon: My pleasure

230
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,470
>> Phil: And thank you
