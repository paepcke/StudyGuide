Hereâ€™s our first quiz. You generate a perfectly
random key K. You send two messages, M1 and

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,700
M2, encrypted with the one-time pad algorithm.
So C1 is equal to K XOR M1, and C2 is equal

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,470
to K XOR M2. Does sending C2 leak information
about M1 and M2?
