00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,630
Answer: It will take 150 milliseconds. So
250 milliseconds in total.

2
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,990
In this figure, blue lines are segments from
the client to server, and red are from the

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:19,990
server to client. The SYN SYN-ACK exchange
takes 100 milliseconds

4
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:27,060
The first request will take 60 milliseconds
to arrive, at which point, 160 ms, the server

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,529
can begin sending a
response. It enqueues two segments to send.

6
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:36,460
As the first response segment goes out over
the link,

7
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,530
the server receives the second request, and
enqueues 2 more response segments. This means

8
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,430
that
the responses will take a total of 90 milliseconds

9
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,720
to arrive after the first request arrives.
The

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:56,720
additional packetization delay of the 2nd
request is masked by the queueing of responses.

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,300
So this means it will take a total of 480
milliseconds: 230 milliseconds for the initial

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,700
request / response of the HTTP page, then
an addition 250 milliseconds to fetch the

13
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,439
two images.
