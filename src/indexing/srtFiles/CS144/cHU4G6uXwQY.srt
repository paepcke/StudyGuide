1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,642
So in this video, we talk about wireless
networking, and why wireless systems turn

2
00:00:04,642 --> 00:00:07,680
out in practice to be really different from
wired ones.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,389
One of the big challenges you see today on
the Internet is, we all want to connect

4
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:15,754
wirelessly, yet there have been a lot of
assumptions made historically that

5
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:19,817
networks should behave like wired ones.
And actually reaching that to wireless is

6
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:23,829
often difficult, which is why we see poor
performance, say, on your laptop using

7
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:26,091
WiFi.
So in this video I'm going to talk really

8
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:29,604
about why is wireless different?
What are these properties that make it so

9
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:32,349
challenging and so difficult?
And why does it sometimes seem to be

10
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:34,941
flaky?
So in the context of this video, I'm going

11
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:38,590
to focus on access point networks, and by
that I mean.

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:44,030
Wireless networks, where, say you have your
laptop,

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,909
with some WiFi card,
and it connects to

14
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:54,740
some access point,
which then has a wired connection to the

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:01,166
internet .
And this access point is serving

16
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,980
- and it's often multiple devices,
like, here's your phone.

17
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:12,271
This is different than say a mobile phone
network or, you know, a 3G or 4G, which

18
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,858
are managed very differently.
Much more tightly controlled.

19
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:18,688
All kinds of different issues emerge in
those systems.

20
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:24,545
Here we're just going to focus on open,
open standards, access point networks, you

21
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:27,157
know, things which you just plug in at
home, connect to your wire connection to

22
00:01:27,157 --> 00:01:31,323
bridge to the broader Internet.
So the first thing to realize about

23
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:35,010
wireless is that, unlike in a wired
network where the medium, the wire, is

24
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,800
completely under your control -
there's nobody fighting you for the

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,694
capacity of that wire.
It's for you and you alone.

26
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:45,627
In the wireless environment you're using
space, right you're using the

27
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:49,674
electromagnetic spectrum around you which
everyone else might be wanting to use as

28
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:52,547
well.
It's not a controlled medium.

29
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:56,441
It's a shared medium.
And so in practice what this means is that

30
00:01:56,441 --> 00:02:00,449
it is very tightly regulated.
So this is a map of how, just in the

31
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:05,751
United States, radio spectrum is allocated.
So radio spectrum - here's kind of the big

32
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,831
picture of RF.
Or not of RF but of electromagnetic

33
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,063
spectrums down from very low frequency
stuff all the way up to cosmic rays.

34
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:16,575
That's this big thing down at the bottom.
So this is something you can get from the

35
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:19,726
US Department of Commerce, this is a free
government document.

36
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:23,178
And so generally, data communication is
occurring in this region down here,

37
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:26,508
different kinds of communication.
Either data communication, voice

38
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:30,026
communication, etc.
Up above, what's in this picture here,

39
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:35,690
this yellow region, is infrared, and then
here's visible light here.

40
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,505
So,
here's visible light, here's ultra-violet,

41
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:44,067
x-rays, gamma rays, et cetera.
But RF is down here.

42
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:47,110
So below visible light.
Lower frequencies.

43
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,704
And here's what the spectrum looks like.
And so you can see there's a huge chunk of

44
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:55,012
spectrum where it's going all the way from
three kilohertz.

45
00:02:55,012 --> 00:03:01,675
So when you have 3000 waves per second, up
to 300 gigahertz up or 300 billion

46
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:05,907
waves per second.
So, if given that RF or that

47
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:09,566
electromagnetic wave moves at one foot per
nano second,

48
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:15,336
at 3 kilohertz you're looking at waves
that are on the order of 300,000

49
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:19,797
- sorry - yeah,
300,000 feet long.

50
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:25,199
Whereas down to the 300 gigahertz range.
You're looking at waves that are 1/300th

51
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,983
of a foot long.
So a huge, huge range of frequencies for

52
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:32,073
all kinds of things, you know?
There's TV, there's radio, there's data

53
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:33,449
communication.
There are maritime systems, there are

54
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:36,090
military systems.
There are satellites, etc.

55
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,735
But when we talk about access point
networks.

56
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,934
And modern data communication systems,
we're talking about these three, these

57
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:52,000
four narrow chunks.
So, these green ones are telephony.

58
00:03:57,202 --> 00:04:00,845
So it's down to 800, 900 megahertz range.
700 this is the 1.9.

59
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:05,520
Telephony and WiMax and that stuff is
starting to move up but basically 3G

60
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,345
standards are down here.
And these two blocks, see these two red

61
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:17,758
blocks, this is Wifi.
And so when you think about all of the

62
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:22,375
data communication that we use today,
phones and laptops, it's all squished into

63
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:27,029
these two - these four tiny little slices.
Now the really important thing to realize

64
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:31,513
about wireless is that [laugh] as you can
imagine, wireless transmission, it's not a

65
00:04:31,513 --> 00:04:33,620
wire.
The wireless medium is not a wire.

66
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,628
And what this means is that, unlike
something propagated on a wire, where

67
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:42,774
there's some attenuation or there's some
resistance in the copper, a wireless signal

68
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:47,600
is radiating over space.
Like, in the simplest, if you have a

69
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,750
perfect omnidirectional antenna, it's
radiating in a, it's getting sort of in a

70
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,810
sphere, out.
And what this means is that the signal

71
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,145
strength degrades with distance at R^2 or
faster, right?

72
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:01,731
A signal when you are twice as far away
from a transmitter,

73
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:07,819
the signal is at least attenuated by 75%.
It's at a quarter of the strength.

74
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:10,820
Just because - think of the surface of a
sphere.

75
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,517
And so what this means is that, unlike in
a wired system, where we can know, oh, the

76
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:17,896
cable, as long as it's good and it's no
longer than 100 meters, we're going to

77
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:21,183
have a strong signal strength.
In wireless systems, you often have a very

78
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:23,830
weak signal strength.
In fact, people are going to try and get

79
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,254
all the way to the edge, because they want
to be sitting out, you know, on the lawn,

80
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:30,532
using their wi-fi access point.
Furthermore, unlike a wire, where it's

81
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:33,508
tightly controlled, there's nobody doing
stuff.

82
00:05:33,508 --> 00:05:37,074
Wireless is out in the world around you.
So, it can be that somebody steps between

83
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:40,396
you and your access point.
Now, suddenly, all these wireless signals

84
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:43,315
have to go through that person.
If there is a big bag of water,

85
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:45,830
the wireless is going to become much, much
weaker.

86
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,152
And so the signal strength is going to
change significantly over time.

87
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:52,927
As people open doors, people move around,
as you move around, as the humidity

88
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:55,402
changes.
Furthermore, there, everyone else is using

89
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:57,828
the medium as well.
There's lots of interference.

90
00:05:57,828 --> 00:06:00,102
It's not like you have this wire to
yourself.

91
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:03,943
Instead, you know, the person next door
might be using their wireless network,

92
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:06,990
which is on the same frequency.
So let's look at the first of these signal strengths.

93
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,290
So.

94
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,877
The problem here is that there are
obstructions in the real world.

95
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:13,472
And they can move around.
And they weaken the signal.

96
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:17,608
If you stand behind a metal plate, your
wireless signal will be much weaker than

97
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:21,627
if you stood in front of it.
Furthermore, wireless signals reflect.

98
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:29,440
And so it can be that I'm standing, you
know, in some hallway here with my laptop.

99
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,654
And there's an access point here,
And it might be that the signal I get is

100
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:38,934
some weird reflection off of different
media,

101
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:43,961
off of different walls.
And the trick here is that, in practice,

102
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:45,992
this means that,
for example, here, I'm getting this

103
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:48,057
reflection.
But I'm also getting a direct signal, say,

104
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:52,251
through these walls.
It's that, unlike in a wire, in a wireless

105
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:53,885
environment, you can have something called
multipath.

106
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:57,290
That, you're getting the signal, but
you're getting multiple copies of it

107
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,646
across different paths or different
delays.

108
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:03,809
Think of it like echoes in a canyon.
Where there's the direct sound you hear.

109
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:07,443
But then all of these echoes are taking different
paths, reflecting off the walls of a

110
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:11,265
canyon.
There's no perfectly uniform antenna.

111
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,283
So if you move a little to the left, it
could be that, that antenna's no good and

112
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:18,520
that's actually much weaker where you are,
so suddenly the signal goes down and you

113
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,934
lose connection.
Furthermore, all these things are

114
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:24,087
continuously changing.
You can imagine, you move a little bit and

115
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:28,559
suddenly there the multipath changes, the
reflections change.

116
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,984
You can imagine I move a little bit, the
antenna's a little different, it's

117
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:34,137
oriented differently.
And so things are dynamically changing the

118
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,255
environment around you.
It's not controlled.

119
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,826
It could be somebody closes their office
door and suddenly your wireless signal

120
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,732
goes out.
Just to give you a sense of what this

121
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:47,114
looks like - so this is some data collected
by a student of mine who's now faculty at

122
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:52,670
Ohio State - Columb.
And what it is showing you is signal

123
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,840
strength over time, down here in the bottom,
what is called the received signal

124
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,069
strength indicator - signal strength.
And then at the top, the observed packet

125
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:06,492
reception ratios.
This is for an 802.15.4 link that is measured.

126
00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:11,850
And so the transmitter is stationary,
the receiver is stationary,

127
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,497
And for every packet received, it
logged what was the received signal

128
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:19,601
strength and then he was observing what
percentage of packets were received over

129
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:21,982
time.
This red line shows the long-term average

130
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:23,513
of this communication.
So actually pretty good.

131
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:27,242
Around 93%.
But what we can see is that, over the space of

132
00:08:27,242 --> 00:08:29,708
just a couple of seconds.
The signal strength is pretty solid up at

133
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,796
84 dBm, that's the units,

134
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:35,766
you know, it drops down a little bit.
Things get a little worse,

135
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,281
It drops down.
And then, suddenly it drops.

136
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:43,139
And it just drops by around 6, or
around 8 DBM, or around 8 DB.

137
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,119
So around a factor of ten or so, or
five, five to ten.

138
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:51,644
And then, what happens is that, that is
below the signal strength at which this

139
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:56,651
device can receive packets.
So the packet reception ratio drops to 0%.

140
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,776
- for a short period, then it comes up and

141
00:08:58,776 --> 00:09:02,289
starts receiving packets again.
And so it's just over the space of here of

142
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:05,291
ten seconds or so.
We see that your link is going from your

143
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:09,899
99% down to 85%, back up to 90%,

144
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,100
down to 0% to 70%.
You see these significant changes over

145
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,031
time.
And so somehow your network,

146
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,952
- think about TCP, think about all those
retransmission schemes - has to deal with this kind

147
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:24,854
of behavior.
So here I'm going to show you, in fact, a

148
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:29,635
real-time video of a network we had to
plug here at Stanford called SWAN,

149
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:34,140
the Stanford Wireless Access Network.
It's an 802.11b/g test bed, so Wifi.

150
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:38,480
And it's around 25 nodes or so.
And essentially, what I'm going to show you is

151
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,483
what this network will collect over 2.5
seconds.

152
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:46,371
So this is with a time step of 25 milliseconds, there is 100 time steps, and each

153
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:50,655
of these nodes - Gates is the computer science
department, Packard is the EE-department, there

154
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:57,355
is this street in between, Serra Mall.
And I'm going to show you what this

155
00:09:57,355 --> 00:10:00,561
network looked like over a time.
So for each node, there are lines between

156
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:03,266
nodes which show you the packet reception ratio

157
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:06,703
here of those links.
The dark line means that all the packets

158
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:09,859
are received,
And a very light line or no line, means

159
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,527
that no packets or very few packets are
received.

160
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,872
So watch what's happening with these

161
00:10:17,872 --> 00:10:19,907
links.
How quickly they're changing.

162
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:23,339
This is 2.5 seconds.
And so we can see, links are coming and

163
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:27,236
going, they're changing and on the space
of 25 milliseconds or less.

164
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:31,656
Like, look at this link here at how
it's oscillating between 80% and 10%.

165
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:34,934
Back and forth.
And look at the links between the two.

166
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:39,725
So the point here is that in wireless
networks like WiFi networks, they're

167
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:43,013
highly, highly dynamic.
So in addition to position of the signal

168
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:46,060
strength changing over time, there's also
the issue of interference.

169
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,283
So, a lot of wireless communications today
is occurring in unlicensed

170
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:52,087
- like WiFi, it's access point networks that occur in
unlicensed bands.

171
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:53,729
Bands that don't require license from the
government.

172
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:56,493
Anyone can use this band.
And that's why they're so

173
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:59,789
popular. Because they're free.
But then lots and lots of different

174
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:03,023
technologies share the band.
So here's a map, for example, of just

175
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:08,353
what's going on in the 2.4, basically,
the 2.5

176
00:11:08,353 --> 00:11:10,752
gigahertz range.
This is wifi.

177
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:14,661
Wifi's lower frequency.
So you can see, here's wifi 802.11b.

178
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:18,051
In this different ranges here, you can
see its bandwidth of 22 megahertz.

179
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:22,653
Here's channels one, six, and eleven.
But at the same frequency ranges, there's

180
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:26,918
802.15.4, Zigbee.
A low power, wireless system.

181
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:28,888
Which is using the same range of
frequencies.

182
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,767
Bluetooth uses the same range of
frequencies.

183
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:35,490
So this means that something in 802.11 can
receive interference with something

184
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,002
of 802.15.4, and vice versa.
These are challenges that all these

185
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:41,952
systems have to deal with, that,
they might have good signal.

186
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,520
They might have low noise.
But then someone's interfering with them.

187
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,481
And so for example, if you just look at
what wireless activity is like over time.

188
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:55,505
This is this nice graph which Omprakash Gnawali,
who is now professor at

189
00:11:55,505 --> 00:12:00,826
University of Houston, generated.
This is taken at his data is from USC,

190
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:05,347
which is where he used to be a PhD student.

191
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:08,018
And you can see, look at all these WiFi
activity.

192
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,683
So here's time in seconds, from 0 to
2 minutes, in different WiFi channels, 1 to 11.

193
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:13,935
You can see that the channels 1 and

194
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:17,496
11 are really, really busy.
They're orange, showing lots and lots of

195
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:20,233
WiFi activity.
And so the lesson to take away here is

196
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:22,341
that wireless networks are becoming
increasingly important.

197
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,365
We'd much rather just connect the
Internet wirelessly rather than plug a wire

198
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:30,408
into our laptop.
But generally they don't work as well.

199
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:33,291
They're less reliable,
they're more flaky and this is because of

200
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,719
the fact that they're in this shared medium
that is uncontrolled.

201
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:38,426
Lots of different devices are
using it,

202
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:44,230
the environment is changing around them,
and there's lots of interference.

203
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,558
And so.
In practice what this means is that to try

204
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:53,947
to get wireless to be, you know, good
enough, as to be usable,

205
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:58,663
due to these different properties and different
behaviors, wireless actually ends up using

206
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:03,322
very different algorithms and protocols.
So wireless link layers look different

207
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:07,072
than wired link layers.
Wireless media access control systems look

208
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:10,765
different than wired ones.
So this next series of videos is going to

209
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:14,800
go into some of those differences and
explain how wireless today works.
