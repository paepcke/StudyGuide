00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,740
TLS random values are 32 bytes long (a 4 byte
timestamp and 28 bytes of randomness). The

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,760
pre-master secret is 48 bytes long, 2 bytes
of protocol version and 46 bytes of randomness.

3
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:26,789
Suppose your TLS session uses these to generate
1024 bytes of keys. What is the maximum number

4
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,230
of tries an adversary might have to make to
crack the session keys, assuming an exhaustive

5
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,559
attack? Assume that the adversary can correctly
recompute the output of a pseudo-random function

6
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:46,559
from its input.
Write your answer as the base-2 exponent (i.e.,

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,600
if it would take 231 tries, write 31).
