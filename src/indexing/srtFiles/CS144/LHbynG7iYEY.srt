Nick:

2
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:05,970
So in this unit we're going to be learning
about network security. Usually when read

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,010
about the Internet and networks in the newspaper,
it's because of some security vulnerability

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,010
that's been exploited or found. Of course
we read about these exploits in software,

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,240
but sometimes you read about them at the infrastructure
itself and these are usually exposed because

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,480
an individual, a company, or a country is
attacking someone in order to discover or

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,380
tamper with their data. We're going to start
by learning about the types of attack that

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,800
are quite common. There are many ways to attack
a network, and you're going to be seeing a

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,579
collection of methods that work in a variety
of ways. The first and most common one is

10
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:47,540
to simply eavesdrop, or listen, on someone's
communication. In some networks, this is surprisingly

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,059
easy, and you're going to be surprised at
some of the methods that people use and can

12
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:57,180
be used, and we'll even demonstrate some of
these to you. You can either eavesdrop on

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,550
a broadcast network, like a wireless network,
or you can force the network to expose or

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,929
broadcast in a way that will make it easier
for you to hear. Another type of attack is

15
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:14,659
to masquerade or behave as if you're a piece
of the infrastructure that is providing information

16
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:21,659
back to a sending host. For example, you can
forge ARP responses, you can spoof the response

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,560
from a DHCP server or from a DNS server and
cause a client to a place other than where

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,459
it was thinking of sending it. So you can
either get the data redirected to you, or

19
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,849
you can look at it and pass it on, which is
often called a man-in-the-middle attack, or

20
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:45,259
you can make it impossible for the sender
to communicate with a particular part of the

21
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:49,469
network, and essentially censor or block a
part of the network. Sometimes you're actually

22
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:56,469
about to hijack an entire end host and masquerade
as an end host, and therefore completely terminate

23
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,389
the communication, for example to get someone's
credit card information when they're performing

24
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:07,559
an e-commerce transaction. Another thing that
you can do is prevent someone from being able

25
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:11,009
to communicate at all. This is usually called
a denial of service attack, by overwhelming

26
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,959
the sender, or overwhelming a piece of the
infrastructure, so that the communication

27
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,650
can no longer take place.

28
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:16,989
Phil:

29
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:21,260
So the Internet is dangerous. We're going
to learn the three principles that you can

30
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,780
actually use to secure your network despite
the fact that the Internet itself might be

31
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,180
insecure. First is confidentiality. This is
the idea that we'd like to be able to communicate

32
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,969
securely, that is hidden from everyone else,
despite the fact that they might be able to

33
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:39,719
see what we're saying. So if you have confidentiality,
then you can communicate with another party,

34
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,409
and other people can observe this communication,
but not be able to know what you're saying.

35
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:49,890
The second principle is integrity. So confidentially
let's us communicate without people knowing

36
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,989
what we're saying, but people can still meddle
with it. With integrity, we can be sure that

37
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:58,670
our communications aren't tampered with such
that the message that, say, Nick sent to me,

38
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,159
was actually the message that Nick sent to
me. It wasn't that somebody fussed with it

39
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,739
in between. The third principle is authenticity.
Can I actually be sure that the other party

40
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,069
I'm talking with is whom they say they are?
And it turns out there are some ways to do

41
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:20,069
this. But the basic techniques for both confidentiality,
and integrity, and authenticity, uses cryptography.

42
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:26,170
Mathematical tools, and secrecy and codes.
The idea is that if we use the right cryptographic

43
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:32,099
tools, then we can have secure communication,
even over an insecure network like the Internet.

44
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,060
And so you're going to learn about some basic
cryptographic tools, such as cryptographic

45
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,040
hashes, message authentication codes, symmetric
ciphers, public key cryptography, certificates

46
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,049
and signatures, which are all used in the
Internet today. And so by the end of this

47
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:50,489
unit, you should start to have a sense as
to how should secure your network going forward.
