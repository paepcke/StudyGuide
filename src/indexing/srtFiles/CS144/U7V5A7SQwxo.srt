1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:07,250
So the answer is a, 0xEBEB0027.
Look at the path L0 takes through this network.

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:18,290
R2 is equal to L0 XORed with P1. Since we
know L0 of the first plaintext is all zeroes,

3
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:27,949
this means that P1 is equal to R2, or 0x7B77DCA2.
Since we know P1, we can then compute L0 of

4
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:40,410
the second plaintext by XORing its R2 with
the key. If you XOR 0x7B77DCA2 with 0x0DCDC85,

5
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:57,860
you obtain 0XEBAB0027.
If you didnâ€™t want to do the full XOR, you

6
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,430
could just look at the bottom byte. A2 XORed
with 85 is 27, 2 XORed with 5 is 7 and A XORed

7
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,030
with 8 is 2.
