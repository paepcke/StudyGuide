00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:00,870
Nick:

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,140
In this unit, you learned about the Transport
Layer. Specifically, you learned about the

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,170
three most important Transport layers in use
today. The first, TCP –or the Transmission

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,969
Control Protocol - is used by over 95% of
Internet applications. TCP is almost universally

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,480
used because it provides the reliable, end-to-end,
bi directional byte-stream service that almost

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,710
all applications desire. Most of the videos
In this unit were about TCP. You learned how

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,719
we detect that a packet was not delivered
or was corrupted along the way, and you leaned

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,379
about the mechanisms TCP uses to successfully
retransmit data until it is correctly delivered.

9
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:39,190
We spent 3 videos exploring different methods
for reliably delivering data across the unreliable

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,300
Internet.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,690
The second transport layer we studied is UDP,
or the User Datagram Protocol. UDP is used

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,239
by applications that don’t need the guaranteed
delivery service of TCP, either because the

13
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,920
application handles retransmissions in its
own private way, or because the application

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,170
just doesn’t need reliable delivery. All
UDP does is take application data and create

15
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,830
a UDP datagram. The UDP datagram identifies
the application that the data should be sent

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,110
to at the other end. That’s about it. Although
very few applications use UDP, we saw examples

17
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:21,110
of DNS and DHCP which are both simple request-response
query protocols.

18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:26,720
The third transport layer we studied is ICMP,
or Internet Control Message Protocol. ICMP’s

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,750
main job is to send feedback if things are
going wrong. For example, if a router receives

20
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,280
an IP datagram but doesn’t know where to
send it next, then it sends an ICMP message

21
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,060
back to the source to let it know. ICMP is
very useful for understanding why end to end

22
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,060
communications are not working properly.

23
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,270
Finally, you learned about one of the most
important overarching Architectural Principles

24
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,850
that guided the design of the internet, and
continues to guides our thinking today. It

25
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,990
is called the “End to End Principle”.
We learned about two versions of the End to

26
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,830
End principle: The milder version says that
there are some functions that can only be

27
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,090
correctly implemented at the edges or fringe
of the network; these clearly need to be implemented

28
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:12,269
there. End to end reliable file transfer and
security are two examples. It is OK to help

29
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:16,370
these features by adding functions to the
network, but these can only help, not replace

30
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,819
the end to end functionality. The second,
stronger version of the End to End Principle

31
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,510
says that if we can implement a function at
the end hosts, then we should. The basic idea

32
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,879
is that the network should be kept simple,
streamlined with as few features to go wrong,

33
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,330
slow things down or require upgrading. It
assumes that the end hosts are quite intelligent

34
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,099
– such as a laptop or smartphone – and
can implement many of the features needed

35
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,879
by the application.

36
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,379
Phil:

37
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:44,569
In this unit you studied five main topics

38
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:51,569
1. Three widely used transport layers. TCP
for reliable delivery of a byte stream between

39
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:58,400
applications, UDP as an unreliable delivery
of datagrams between applications, and ICMP

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,400
as a way to detect when things go wrong.
2. How TCP works, with a particular emphasis

41
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:10,859
on how it reliably delivers bytes between
two applications. You learned how data errors

42
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,069
and missing packets are detected, and how
packets are retransmitted as well as several

43
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:20,189
different retransmission strategies, including
selective repeat and go back N. You learned

44
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:24,079
about how the basic TCP mechanism uses Go
Back N and keeps track of the outstanding

45
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,269
unacknowledged bytes using a sliding window.
You also learned about the TCP state machine

46
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:33,279
that keeps track of the current status of
the TCP connection.

47
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:39,810
3. How UDP works and why it is used by a small
number of applications.

48
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:46,029
4. How ICMP works and how it helps us detect
when communications go wrong, and to monitor

49
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:49,069
the performance of the route between two end
hosts.

50
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:55,129
5. You learned about the End to End Principle,
which is an important overarching principle

51
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,790
used in the design of the Internet and many
other communication systems. Throughout this

52
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,579
class – and after you go out into the world
to use your new networking expertize – you’ll

53
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:08,409
find many people talking about this principle
to help guide their design decisions.

54
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:12,739
Phil:
You should now have a good understanding of

55
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:16,190
the three different Transport Layers.
You should understand different retransmission

56
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:22,160
strategies and why TCP uses a “Sliding Window”.
You should know why TCP uses connections,

57
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,680
how they are established and how they are
maintained by a state machine.

58
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,569
You should be able to explain the End to End
Principle.
