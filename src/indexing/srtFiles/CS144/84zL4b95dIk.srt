1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,002
So in this video I'm gonna talk about the
internet.

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:07,034
[laugh], why it's so important and why
really you should take this course.

3
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:12,023
And so the overarching theme here is that
there are some people who would argue that

4
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:16,088
in the past twenty or 30 years the most
important invention of our generation is

5
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:21,020
the internet in terms of what it's
accomplished, how it has transformed the

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,040
world, the economy, politics, and society,
and by understanding how it works,

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,000
understanding how it's been built, what it
can do, what it can't do, you'll have a

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,080
much greater understanding about this
tremendous engine of change.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,067
So let's just take a few simple societal
examples.

10
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:38,089
So.
You know today if you think in terms of

11
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:42,092
economics, and the economic changes the
internet has brought, think about things

12
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:45,052
like black Friday.
So black Friday is the day after

13
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:49,055
thanksgiving in the United States when
it's given that name because all of the

14
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:53,048
stores go from the red, that is they've
lost money over the year to the black

15
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:57,061
because so much is bought for Christmas,
and so this is historically this time of

16
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:01,085
tremendous sales, and tremendous you know,
purchasing people will get up early to go

17
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:05,075
to the mall, all of that.
But today, Black Friday is still of course

18
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:10,045
important, but now there's Cyber Monday,
when people, after the Thanksgiving

19
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:14,078
holiday, the next Monday, log in online to
buy gifts for the holidays.

20
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:20,007
In the sense of its the ability for people
to buy things online so easily has really

21
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:25,005
changed our purchasing patterns.
Enough so now there is legislation in the

22
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:29,091
United States in the legislature to
examine whether or not it's fairer that

23
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:34,070
these online vendors don't have to pay,
the people who buy things from online

24
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,043
vendors don't have to pay sales tax,
whereas brick and mortar vendors, people

25
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:43,054
do have to pay sales tax.
Suddenly places like Amazon have a price

26
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:48,022
Benefit that they have, that they can give
a better price, because people don't have

27
00:01:48,022 --> 00:01:50,066
to pay.
Taxes on things which are bought from

28
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:53,012
Amazon.
So there's been lots of legislation about

29
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:57,023
trying to control this and is it unfair to
brick and mortar, but the fact that the

30
00:01:57,023 --> 00:02:01,020
presence of online purchasing is leading
to legislation because of concerns of

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,091
competition says something about the
economic effect that the Internet is

32
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,553
having.
Or you look at something far more

33
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:10,070
personal, such as dating.
So, before the internet, you know, how do

34
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,062
meet people?
Well, through friends.

35
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:15,099
Maybe there's, you know, classified ads in
the newspaper.

36
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,089
Or you go to a bar or try to meet people
that way.

37
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:23,025
Today, there are all these services.
Okcupid, Match.com, for connecting people

38
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:25,087
online.
So it's changing how people meet each

39
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:29,377
other, and how people date.
And as you know some of these sites will

40
00:02:29,377 --> 00:02:34,298
claim that some significant fraction of
the people that meet on their sites

41
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:37,037
eventually become married.
Think in terms of knowledge.

42
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:41,037
So before, if you wanted to read a book,
you would go to the library and you'd

43
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:43,097
check it out.
Today, things like Google books, where

44
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:48,018
there are millions of books that have been
scanned in, and anyone can read at any

45
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:50,073
time.
Things like e-books delivered over these

46
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:53,038
wireless networks like the whispernet.
Or Wikipedia.

47
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:57,033
You used to, if you wanted to look
something up, you used to have to go to an

48
00:02:57,033 --> 00:03:00,009
encyclopedia.
If you were very lucky, maybe you had an

49
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:03,026
old encyclopedia at home.
But usually, you'd go to the library.

50
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:05,050
Now, anytime you wanna know something
about.

51
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,003
And something that's not too obscure, you
can go to Wikipedia and learn something

52
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:12,044
about it.
Finally, communication, so, you know,

53
00:03:12,044 --> 00:03:17,003
there are beginnings of IRC chat, chat
programs on the internet but think about

54
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:20,084
before we had instant messaging or
voice-over IP or video telephony.

55
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:25,027
Video Conferencing was this technology of
the future, the idea you could have a

56
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:29,097
video call and really it was the internet
and just this cheap inexpensive always on

57
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:33,062
omnipresent data communication system is
what made that possible.

58
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:38,015
So it really changed how we interact with
people on a day to day basis when it's

59
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:40,049
available.
So that's just society.

60
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,094
How we interact with one another in the
fabric of interpersonal relationships.

61
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:49,000
There's also been significant political
change brought by the internet.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,096
So you look at something like the Arab
Spring, where.

63
00:03:51,096 --> 00:03:56,078
People who are revolting against the
Government are coordinating using SMS, or

64
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:59,317
Twitter.
So, it's actually a story where during the

65
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:04,044
revolution in Iran, that Twitter was
planning on taking it's server down for

66
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:09,353
the weekend for an upgrade and the United
States of America State Department called

67
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:13,070
up twitter and said, 'We're sorry.
There's a revolution, or an uprising going

68
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,086
on and they're using twitter a lot.
Please keep your servers online.' So

69
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:22,037
political change in the world is greatly
effected by these technologies we're

70
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:26,053
seeing deployed on the internet.
Or think in terms of diplomacy with the

71
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:30,099
recent Wiki leaks about all of these
United States diplomatic cables and how

72
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:34,017
that effects diplomatic relations
throughout the world.

73
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:38,091
A tremendous effect that would have been
inconceivable before the very, very rapid

74
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:41,086
spread of information the internet makes
available.

75
00:04:41,086 --> 00:04:47,015
Or you look within, say the United States,
are the occupy movement, Occupy Wall

76
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:52,045
Street, Occupy Oakland, organized through
Twitter and through Facebook, these online

77
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:56,032
social media which, for which the internet
is their backbone.

78
00:04:56,032 --> 00:05:02,059
Finally, you also see politics not only in
terms of uprising and diplomacy but also,

79
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:07,069
in terms of politics by force.
So one of example of this is, the STUX

80
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:13,081
network, which was in internet capable
worm that shut down the centrifuges in a

81
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:19,093
row, damaged the centrifuges that were
being thought to be enriching nuclear

82
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:23,057
material.
So this is an example of, what looks like

83
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:28,196
a state, a government producing
essentially a cyber weapon which is

84
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:33,268
intended to spread over an internet style
network designed very specifically to

85
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:38,983
sabotage these devices at this location.
So you see the internet used not only for

86
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:43,519
personal connections, personal
interactions as well as organization.

87
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,530
But also even for political changes by
force.

88
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,672
Now in terms of the scope of these
economic changes, this was recently I just

89
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:56,620
went on April sixteenth, so just a few
months ago, and I looked up who are the

90
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,638
hundred richest people in the world.
So the top billionaires list from Forbes.

91
00:06:01,638 --> 00:06:06,656
And if you look You know number 24 is
Sergey Brin and Larry Page co founders of

92
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:10,321
Google.
Number 26 Jeff Bezos CEO of Amazon.

93
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:14,215
Number 35 at the time was Mark Zuckerberg
CEO of Facebook.

94
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:20,107
These are all people whose billions have
been made by new services, applications

95
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:24,480
and uses of the internet.
And so just think about the through the

96
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,009
amount of.
Shift of capital and shift of economics

97
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:32,828
and economic models that the Internet is
bringing, that gosh, in, in the past decade

98
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:36,087
or so.
You're seeing some of the richest people

99
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:41,427
in the world have achieved that through
effectively the use and growth of the

100
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:44,287
Internet.
And I think this points at a more broader,

101
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:47,191
point, about technology and what's
happening today.

102
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:52,101
So I would argue that we're in the midst
of second or, depending on the count, it's

103
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:56,120
second or third industrial revolution.
This idea of this tremendous upheaval, of

104
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,483
how we conduct business, how we produce
goods.

105
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:03,430
In terms of trade, in terms of the kinds
of skills that are necessary for modern

106
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,718
industries.
And so, this is some data that I collected

107
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:11,473
from, this is United States data only,
from the United States Department of Labor

108
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,237
and Department of Education.
And so what it shows is for four

109
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:20,023
scientific engineering degrees, the number
of degrees granted in the United States

110
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:24,639
each year and the number of job openings
each year projected over the next ten

111
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,162
years.
So, there's data for the job openings

112
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:30,077
projected 2008-2018 from the U.S.
Department of Labor.

113
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:33,818
And the job, and the actual degrees are
2008 data from the United States

114
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:37,189
Department of Education.
And so if you want some details about how

115
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:39,519
I got this data, there's this url down
here.

116
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,639
But the basic point here is that you can
see that in most disciplines, you know

117
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,066
there are fewer jobs, than there are
degrees and that's normal because not

118
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:54,382
everyone who gets an engineering degree
say, goes into engineering, they can do

119
00:07:54,382 --> 00:07:58,918
other things with that degree.
But there is this tremendous discrepancy

120
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:03,687
for computer science, that the number of
degrees which at least the United States

121
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:07,751
is producing each year in computer
science, is only a small fraction, you

122
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:11,037
know, effectively a third of the number of
job openings.

123
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:15,767
There's tremendous economic growth in this
area which we educationally, in terms of

124
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:20,456
societally  have not yet caught up with.
So, learning about these kind of things,

125
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:25,490
learning about the Internet, because it is
such a core aspect of this, is something

126
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,887
which is of tremendous, practical value in
the job market.

127
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:33,424
It's important in our every day society.
In fact, if you had pull apart those

128
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:38,598
160,000 jobs per year that are appearing
in the United States, in fact, you know

129
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:43,655
there are a lot of them are software
engineers, as you may think people who are

130
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:48,659
in software a lot of them are database
administrators, but if you look there are

131
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:52,524
a bunch of very large categories here.
Networking computer systems

132
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:56,449
administrators, people who are
administering computer systems and

133
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:59,131
networks.
People who are analyzing data

134
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:03,729
communication systems and network systems.
And so the point being that actually

135
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:10,216
there's significant, almost a quarter of
the computer science jobs each year.

136
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:15,067
So 40,000 jobs a year approximately have
to do with computer networks, which is not

137
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,280
to say that even these software
engineering jobs.

138
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,918
Many of them have to do with computer
networks as well.

139
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:22,493
You're building a new web application, new
web service.

140
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:24,799
This all involves the use of networks and
the internet.

141
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,942
So correspondingly, understanding how the
internet works, understanding the design

142
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:32,011
principles of networks.
How they work, why they're built this way.

143
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:36,464
Good design principles for building future
networks, future network applications,

144
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:41,332
future network systems is of tremendous
value going forward in terms of knowing it

145
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:45,506
as a practical skill but also to
understand what is becoming a tremendous

146
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:49,311
linchpin of modern society.
And so this course is gonna teach you

147
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,718
exactly that.
It's gonna teach you how computer networks

148
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,020
work.
Not only their implementation, as an

149
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,028
example of a very successful on the
internet, but also the design principles

150
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:02,194
that lead you there.
So as the internet evolves, as it does

151
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:06,018
every day, you'll understand the
principles that lead that evolution, that

152
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:08,860
guide that evolution.
Such that even if we use slightly

153
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,856
different protocols in five years, you'll
still be able to understand.

154
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:15,815
Because you'll understand the principles
behind network design.

155
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,098
And so.
In theory, or the hope would be that if

156
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:21,342
you take this course, you'll not only
understand the internet of today, but

157
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:24,132
you'll also have the
Intellectual tools to understand the

158
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:26,767
internet of tomorrow, as it evolves
towards that.

159
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:30,695
And it's also gonna give you a background
of what are the forces that shape the

160
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:33,353
internet.
So it's a technological marvel and an

161
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:37,080
amazing feat of engineering.
But what makes it especially interesting,

162
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,655
at least to me, is that it's shaped not
only by engineering concerns.

163
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:44,231
But also by real world economic political
and societal  concerns.

164
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:48,112
If you read about how the internet is
being used in politics, or it's effects on

165
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:52,037
the Arab spring, or the Stuxnet worm.
Or it's effects on economies, to whether

166
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:55,088
or not how internet commerce is going to
be regulated or governed.

167
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:59,550
What about things like off-shore gambling
and how that's managed?

168
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,140
All of these kinds of questions affect
legislation, affect how the Internet is

169
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,395
developed, affect how it's governed.
And that has tremendous implications on

170
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:10,584
its design.
So it's this interesting.

171
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:15,694
Interface and mix between not only deep
technical concepts but also the societal

172
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:21,299
needs, and the societal wants, and our
societal rules that we use to use those

173
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:24,804
concepts.
And, basically make a better world for the

174
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:29,658
future through data communication.
So now that's the, the basic overview.

175
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:34,915
Internet's astoundingly important.
It's going to become only more important

176
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:38,943
as time goes on.
And so understanding it is a, a very, very

177
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:42,371
valuable thing.
And so I encourage you to do so and take

178
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:43,063
this course.
