00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,669
Nick: So in this unit, we're going to be learning
about how to control congestion in networks.

2
00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:11,559
You already know about something called flow
control. Flow control is when we try to prevent

3
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:18,559
a sender from overwhelming a receiver by the
receiver telling the sender to slow down.

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,770
Congestion control is essentially extending
that notion to the network as a whole. You

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,520
can imagine that if senders were to send too
many packets into the network, they're going

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,650
to overwhelm the network. The buffers of the
routers are going to fill up, the links are

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,500
going to overflow, and we're going to start
dropping packets. Clearly not a very good

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,300
thing to happen. So congestion control is
about preventing the senders from overwhelming

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,300
the network. So that leads us to ask how do
we do it? What do we want from a congestion

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,010
control mechanism? First, clearly, it needs
to prevent the overwhelming from happening.

11
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,859
And second, we generally want it to spread
the pain evenly. We want to make sure that

12
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:01,489
all of the flows that are being controlled,
are being controlled in a fair and equal way.

13
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:06,540
Phil: So one of the big questions that comes
up is we want to control congestion, but how

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,190
should we do it? Where should we do it? Should
we do it at the edge? Should we do it within

15
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:17,190
the network? Well if we follow the end-to-end
argument - the strong end-to-end argument,

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,180
it would say that we want the network to just
forward packets. We want the intelligence

17
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,540
to be at the edges. And so that's actually
in practice often what's done today. So in

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,280
this unit, we're going to talk about TCP and
how TCP controls congestion. It turns out

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,670
it's one of its most important features. That
a TCP sender, a TCP receiver, particularly

20
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,950
a sender, can control how many packets it
puts into a network, to make sure that it

21
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,600
doesn't overwhelm the network, it controls
the congestion. And so it's the end-to-end

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,520
approach, leaving the inside of the network
simple. And it turns out you can just do it

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,110
at the edge, and it turns out you can do it
very well. So TCP congestion control chose

24
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,430
to use a particular algorithm called additive
increase, multiplicitive decrease, or AIMD.

25
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,209
And it turns out that this algorithm has a
lot of really interesting properties, when

26
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:14,670
you actually look at how behaves in even very
large, complex networks with millions of flows

27
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,549
competing. It has some very nice stable properties
that allow it to control congestion well,

28
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,159
and also in a fair way.

29
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,280
Nick: It turns out it's such an important
idea, by many it's considered one of the crown

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,249
jewels of networking. It's one of the most
important intellectual ideas to have found

31
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:38,120
its way into the network. It's in TCP. It's
been in TCP now for about 25 years. And so

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,239
it's a very significant part of controlling
congestion in the Internet. So in this unit,

33
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,099
you're going to be learning about what congestion
control is, the kinds of properties that we

34
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:55,019
would like from a congestion control algorithm,
what the specific congestion control mechanisms

35
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,069
are that are used in TCP, the AIMD that Phil
just mentioned. And you're going to be learning

36
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:04,010
a lot of details about how that works, how
it's implemented in practice, how it works

37
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,969
in different scenarios, what happens when
you have one flow, what happens when you have

38
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:13,120
many flows. And you're going to be learning
a lot about not only what TCP is today, but

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,930
it's going to give you a lot of insight into
what TCP congestion control might become in

40
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,500
the future.
