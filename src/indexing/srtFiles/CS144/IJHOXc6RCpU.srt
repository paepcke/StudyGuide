1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:08,639
Phil: Hi, so I’m here with Kevin Fall at
a computer science conference at the symposium

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,960
of operating systems principles. I have run
into him here, so I thought that actually

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,340
hearing a bit about what he has to say about
the Internet would be interesting. So, Kevin,

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:26,029
you’re currently the author of TCP/IP Illustrated,
so how did that happen? What’s your relationship

5
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:31,349
with TCP and the stuff that you’ve done
in the past. What’s your background with

6
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,160
TCP/IP?

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:39,160
Kevin: So, I guess, right after I graduated,
and shortly after I got to Berkeley, somebody

8
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,800
demonstrated to me that they could send some
packet to Europe and back to Berkeley in under

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,909
a second, and I thought networking became
sort of an interesting thing to look at. Fast

10
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:58,909
forward a number of years, I worked on networking
implementation of Berkeley unix on a Cray

11
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:06,670
for a while, that got me a little bit into
the HPC community, but then I worked at Lawrence

12
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,680
Berkeley National Lab after my graduate work
at UC San Diego. So at UC San Diego, I was

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,550
doing some protocol work and some operating
system work, but then with the networking

14
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,690
group at LBL, that was all quite a bit in
the networking side, and worked on network

15
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:29,630
simulators, the NS simulator and so on. What
happened though is I got to know this stuff

16
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:36,630
pretty well, and by the early 90s or mid 90s
when the Internet was becoming more widely

17
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,630
known, people took an interest in what is
the TCP IP stuff, and this particular book,

18
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:49,680
TCP IP illustrated, was the standard reference
text, and the volume one is still quite a

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,680
good book. I was teaching out of it, teaching
professionals from Cisco and places like that,

20
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,930
and so I got to know the material quite well,
but as the years went on and on and on, there

21
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,930
were things that it would be nice to be updated
in that book, and so there were places I had

22
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,329
heard where some people were approached to
rewrite it, other people approached the editor,

23
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:24,030
Addison, to rewrite it, and for whatever reason,
it never happened. And so I threw in my table

24
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,189
of contents and sample chapter, and got the
job some seven years later finished off the

25
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:33,139
entire task of something that’s over 1,000
pages long.

26
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:37,400
Phil: So what’s an example of something
that you thought sort of had changed and needed

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,959
to be introduced, but wasn’t in the original
text?

28
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,959
Kevin: One of the major ones is security.
So there’s like 100 pages of security that

29
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,430
goes through the introduction of, what are
the sort of basic primitives, what are the

30
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,900
sort of things you might want to protect against,
all the various details of the protocols that

31
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,090
actually does that. Really, with security,
not only the cryptographic parts of security,

32
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,519
but things like firewalls and stuff, really
barely existed when the first work was done.

33
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,400
There’s also a new chapter at the beginning,
that’s sort of the architectural underpinnings.

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,739
What was in the minds of people when they
were thinking about the design decisions when

35
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,189
this stuff was made? So I always found that
quite interesting, and being an operating

36
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:30,590
systems guy originally, how people came up
with abstractions and how programs access

37
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:37,590
those things and not quite users necessarily,
and what are the sort of architectural concerns?

38
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:43,019
So I was always quite interested in papers
and thoughts in the architectural area.

39
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:49,090
Phil: And so last night we were talking, and
you said that today people use the terms datagram

40
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,639
and packet interchangeably, but those were
not interchangeable terms. They actually meant

41
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:59,290
something quite different, which is now sort
of lost in time.

42
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:06,290
Kevin: So I think I mentioned this in part
of the book, and packets were sort of a fascinating

43
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,730
new concept, that you could divide your larger
message into little parts, and move them around

44
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:18,030
the network. But they were originally, at
least some variant, were part of virtual circuits,

45
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:24,330
and so for example, the destination in a packet
was the destination of an index of a table

46
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,220
in the next hop. So you would sort of set
up the route ahead of time, and then if that

47
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,060
failed for some reason, you have a bunch of
work to do to go back, and there’s all the

48
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:40,060
history of circuits. But datagrams were a
maybe even more radical idea, where the final

49
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,660
destination is identified in the packet structure,
which when I would teach this class, I would

50
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,590
say if I laid out the network in a two-dimensional
space, with this datagram type property, I

51
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,870
could take it and drop it from the air down
onto any router, and it would find it’s

52
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,629
way through, because the final destination
was listed. But of course that was a tradeoff,

53
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:04,440
because now you have more bits that you have
to allocate, because there’s presumably

54
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,949
a larger number of destinations available.
So these were the kind of nuances that were

55
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,849
actually pretty neat to get the details from
by going back in the architectural history

56
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:20,919
and thinking and learning about what people
were sort of arguing about what people were

57
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,289
sort of arguing about at the time.

58
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,840
Phil: Cool, so what are you working on now?
What are the most interesting things, do you

59
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,270
think, in networking, and the Internet, and
systems that you’re trying to tackle.

60
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,539
Kevin: So there’s a couple areas that I
think are fun and sort of worth mentioning,

61
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:43,539
at least one of which we have some work on.
The first one, we don’t have so much work

62
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:51,159
on, but is the him and some of his colleagues
and predecessors had envisioned that not only

63
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,139
to we have a thing that winds up essentially
being today’s Internet, that there’s communication

64
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,330
in these communities. But there’s also a
physical way of moving things around, which

65
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,659
was like a global pneumatic tube system. So
you could take your thing, shove it, and it

66
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:12,840
would sort of find its way, which would be
a very cool thing to have. But I don’t think

67
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,840
we’re quite there yet. But on the other
hand, I think that 3d printing technology,

68
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,319
as combined with what’s going on with the
free and easy dissemination of information,

69
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,819
becomes quite interesting, especially when
you can print things other than plastics and

70
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:40,819
so on. So I had in my hand a demonstration
that was a titanium 3d printed nose replacement

71
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:48,530
part, a prosthetic nose, and it was strands
of titanium printed on top of each other,

72
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:57,129
and if you can load up your device with the
right materials, pretty much any material

73
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:03,629
thing you want to create almost, could be
created. So even into the world of sensor

74
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:08,669
networks, things people looked at sensing
the world, maybe even actuating the world,

75
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:12,120
but like building the world on demand in combination
with those other things is pretty interesting,

76
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,530
and I wonder if that’s not kind of the way
to get to the vision of pneumatic tubes, but

77
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:22,229
instead of removing it, you just make another
one. And so how far in the future will it

78
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:28,150
be that you just carry around in your backpack
or your car the basic system, and then you

79
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:34,770
just download whatever the thing is you happen
to need. There was literally, not even a few

80
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,750
months ago, there was a meeting in Washington
DC about the security implications of additive

81
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,159
manufacturing.

82
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:47,159
Phil: There’s all these questions about
firearms, for example. So generally in firearms,

83
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,699
there’s one piece of the gun that’s strongly
regulated, it’s the one that everything

84
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,599
has to stick onto, and somebody 3 printed
one, it’s normally something you need a

85
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:05,349
license for, and so there’s an interesting
question about what the implications are going

86
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:06,960
forward, with things like DRM.

87
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Kevin: Yeah, there’s lots of policy questions.
I think, as is often the case, technology

88
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:21,099
will outpace the policy ability to comprehend
and instantiate reasonable laws about things,

89
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,919
whatever that may be. And so this idea that
bits become interchangeable with physical

90
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,800
objects, and we have traditionally regulated
the control of physical objects, but now do

91
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:41,799
we have to include digital objects? It’s
pretty interesting, so that’s one of the

92
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,589
topics, and it actually gets into other things
that you can compute with and maybe print

93
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:57,240
and compute, like synthetic biology, like
I want to create a little organism that takes

94
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,190
one thing and something comes out the other
end, well I have biologicals in my 3d printer,

95
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:09,920
and not just download the designs, but have
the tools to do the designs of the biological

96
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,920
systems. So that’s one whole category, that
when I was thinking about the pneumatic tubes,

97
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,120
and then looking at 3d printing and its capabilities,
and now the price is knocked down, so people

98
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,829
can go get them, it’s a pretty interesting
thing.

99
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:33,700
Phil: Cool, well it was great chatting with
you, and thank you for your time, so yeah.

100
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,980
See you next time.
