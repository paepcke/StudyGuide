00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,310
You will have heard people say many times
that the Internet has transformed society

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,470
in profound ways, not seen since the invention
of the printing press.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,830
In this video, I will give you a brief background
on the history of networking leading up to

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,200
the invention of the Internet in the 1960s.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,200
Let’s start with a brief history of how
messages were communicated over long distances.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,869
While today we think nothing of sending an
email to the other side of the world, 3,000

7
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:30,980
years ago it was very hard to communicate
over long distances.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,590
The first recorded long distance communications
are from about 1,000 BC and were mostly put

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,480
in place for military offense and defensive
purposes.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,300
Fire beacons were used to signal the arrival
of an enemy, or to synchronize an attack.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,400
This is an example of a fire beacon in the
south of England.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,850
Fire beacons carry information fast, work
particularly well at night when danger is

13
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:58,850
greatest, but they carry very little information.
Generally, they are on or off, signaling danger.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,530
Carrier pigeons, human messengers and horse
relays have been used around the world for

15
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,330
thousands of year because they can carry more
information. But the information travels more

16
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,790
slowly than a fire beacon, and messengers
are prone to interception along the way. The

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,920
message could be read, tampered with or blocked
completely.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,820
The earliest recorded relay systems were horses
in Egypt and China 2-3 thousand years ago.

19
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,630
They were common throughout history. In 13th
C, Marco Polo described how the great Mongol

20
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,400
ruler Kublai Khan used horse relays. His army
had relay stations every 40km, with 400 horses

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,200
waiting for relay riders. Horse relays were
used all the way up to 19th century for mail

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,510
delivery in the famous Pony Express across
the USA. These early systems were limited

23
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:50,049
in the information they could carry (fires)
or by the speed of delivery (horses, humans,

24
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,330
pigeons).

25
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:57,030
Around 2,000 years ago, optical methods started
to be used, such as FLAGS, and HELIOGRAPHS,

26
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,600
which encoded digital information such as
letters, words and numbers.

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,799
These systems transmit data at the speed of
light, over limited distances, with limited

28
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,110
information --- they are basically simple
encodings.

29
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,540
Perhaps the biggest advances in optical communications
happened in France around the time of the

30
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:23,270
French Revolution in 1793 when Claude Chappe
invented and starting building a semaphore

31
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,200
telegraph network.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,160
Claude Chappe built towers with a large HORIZONTAL
beam (the REGULATOR), with two smaller arms

33
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,770
called INDICATORS.
It looked like a human being giving different

34
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:42,090
signals with their arms. The location of the
arms indicated a SYMBOL.

35
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:49,090
In 1793, the French government built 15 stations
to cover 190km, or 13km per station. By 1804,

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,400
a 370km network stretched from Paris to Dijon.
The system was used to send a variety of messages,

37
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,900
including military information and fast-breaking
news. Most went towards Paris to report information

38
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,480
from the provinces.
The operators became quite skilled: The fastest

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,910
messages could be signaled by one station
every 10-20seconds, and could cross France

40
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,989
in less than 30 minutes! They could send about
3,000 signs per day, corresponding to a few

41
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,780
hundred messages.

42
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,730
To make the network function properly, the
optical telegraph systems in France and Sweden

43
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,120
developed a number of concepts that are used
in networks to this day:

44
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,540
They needed to develop five concepts in particular:
The first were CODES. These are symbols to

45
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,959
indicate characters, and control signals like:
START OF TX, END OF TX, “WAIT” or “CONFLICT

46
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,959
(When two signals arrived at the same time!)”,
ERROR (cancel last code), PRIORITY (between

47
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,849
conflicting messages), FAILURE of TOWER, Acknowledgment
(of ciphered text from far end), RAIN/FOG

48
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:05,849
to say “we can’t see you!”.
The second was FLOW CONTROL, to stop the sender

49
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,659
overwhelming the receiver. Basically, the
receiver tells the sender to slow down because

50
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,709
it can’t keep up
Third was SYNCHRONIZATION, to tell when one

51
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,290
symbol ended and the next one started. This
helps delineate words made up of several symbols.

52
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,940
The forth concept was ERROR CORRECTION AND
RETRANSMISSION to tell the sender when symbols

53
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,270
were misunderstood. This allows the sender
to try sending the symbols again.

54
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:34,460
Finally, they used ENCRYPTION so that messages
could not be intercepted. They were particularly

55
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,860
worried about news of the stock market beating
the newspapers.

56
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,860
By 1830 the Chappe optical telegraph network
was very extensive, covering most of France.

57
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:54,460
We can characterize four main steps of invention
in communication networks up until the 1700s.

58
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,590
First, from about 2,000 BC, humans used systems
to signal a small set of pre-defined messages,

59
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,570
for example using fire beacons.

60
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,449
Second, starting in the 1600s, people developed
systems to transmit arbitrary messages, by

61
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:10,300
encoding the entire alphabet.

62
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,680
By the early 1700s, numeric codes started
to be used for common words and phrases. This

63
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,530
was the earliest form of compression, because
it required less information to be sent over

64
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,410
the link.

65
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,530
During the 1700s, codes were developed for
control signals. They could communicate when

66
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,930
to start and stop sending, when to slow down,
how to retransmit and so on. This was the

67
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,669
birth of what we call today “Protocols”
– the agreed upon rules governing how two

68
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,840
or more parties communicate.

69
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,270
By 1800 there were a number of different optical
telegraph systems deployed across Europe,

70
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:52,270
using a variety of different protocol signals,
such as these.

71
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:14,190
Clearly there was an enormous step forward
in communications when the telephone was invented

72
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,180
at the end of the 19th century.

73
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,330
For some time, there had been many attempts
to increase the capacity of the electrical

74
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,870
telegraph network that now connected many
towns across the United States.

75
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,900
Alexander Graeme Bell – a Scottish born
inventor – transmitted the first voice call

76
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,139
in 1876 in the very celebrated phone call
to his colleague, Thomas Watson.

77
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,259
While his patent was challenged many times,
most notably by fellow inventor Elisha Gray,

78
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,560
the patent stood up to the legal challenges
and we generally attribute the invention to

79
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,620
Bell.

80
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,580
Within 10 years over 150,000 people owned
telephones, and by 1915 the first transcontinental

81
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,030
phone call was made from New York to San Francisco.

82
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:05,030
The series of events and inventions that eventually
led to the internet started in 1960.

83
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,539
In 1962, J.C.R. Licklider at MIT started to
write memos and give talks about his concepts

84
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:18,780
of an Intergalactic Network, in which everyone
on the globe is interconnected and can access

85
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,380
programs and data at any site from anywhere.
He talked of being able to communicate with

86
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,720
his own ‘Intergalactic Network’ of researchers
across the country. This is widely thought

87
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,020
to be the first recorded description of the
social interactions that could be enabled

88
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,860
by a large communication network - very much
like the Internet of today. Licklider became

89
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,919
the first head of the computer research program
at DARPA - the Defense Advanced Research Projects

90
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,919
Agency - from 1962. While at DARPA he convinced
Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher

91
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:54,860
Lawrence G. Roberts, of the importance of
his new networking concept, and they took

92
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,250
up the mantle when they succeeded him at DARPA.

93
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:04,349
In 1964 researcher Paul Baran wrote what is
now considered the first academic paper about

94
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:09,919
large scale communication networks. The paper
is titled: “On Data Communication networks”.

95
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,380
At about the same time, Leonard Kleinrock’s
thesiswas published on queueing theory. Donald

96
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:21,870
Davies was working on very similar ideas at
the National Physical Laboratory in the UK.

97
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,770
in 1965 working with Thomas Merrill, Larry
Roberts connected the TX-2 computer in Mass.

98
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,669
to the Q-32 in California with a low speed
dial-up telephone line creating the first

99
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,489
wide-area computer network ever built.

100
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:40,669
Larry Roberts joined DARPA in 1966 to help
develop the first ARPANET plans, which were

101
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,739
published in 1967.

102
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:50,480
In 1969 the first four nodes were installed
at UCLA, SRI, UCSB and University of Utah

103
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,949
and the very first messages sent.

104
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:59,689
This is what the Internet looked like in 1969
– it was called the ARPANET and was a single

105
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:04,449
CLOSED, PROPRIETARY network.

106
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:09,369
By the early 1970s a number of different packet-switched
data networks started to appear.

107
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:16,369
In 1971, the first packet radio network was
built between the Hawaii Islands, called AlohaNet.

108
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:21,929
The mechanisms developed for the ALOHA protocol
have influenced pretty much every wireless

109
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:27,800
network since.
Also in 1971 the Cyclades research network

110
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,389
was built in France. It was the first to give
the end hosts the responsibility for reliable

111
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,739
communications, and heavily influenced the
design of the Internet.

112
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:43,040
In 1974 IBM introduced an entire data network
stack called SNA, which stands for Systems

113
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,079
Network Architecture. Its goal was to reduce
the cost of building large time-shared computers

114
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:55,079
with many teletype terminals, rather than
batch processing with punch cards.

115
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,040
DARPA sponsored work on “Internetting”
to create the first “networks of networks”

116
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,579
to connect together networks around the world.
The protocols needed for Internetting were

117
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:11,579
first described by Vint Cerf (Stanford) and
Bob Kahn in a now famous paper in 1974, with

118
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,949
the title: “A Protocol for Packet Network
Intercommunication”.

119
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:21,549
TCP called for reliable, in-sequence delivery
of data and included much of what we call

120
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:26,439
today the Network layer. In the early days
there was no notion of congestion control;

121
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:29,709
it was added to the Internet about 15 years
later.

122
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:35,959
By the end of 1970s, TCP and IP were separated,
making room for UDP to be added as an unreliable

123
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,670
transport service as well, originally for
packetized voice.

124
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:46,670
At the time, Vint Cerf was an Assistant Professor
here at Stanford. He moved to DARPA in 1976

125
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:56,089
to help shepherd the new Internet project.
He is now the Chief Internet Evangelist at

126
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,290
Google.
Bob Kahn was already at DARPA when the paper

127
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:04,989
was written. Together, they are considered
the fathers of the Internet.

128
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:10,399
In 1983 TCP/IP was first deployed across the
ARPAnet in a flag day when everyone upgraded

129
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,980
to use the new protocols.

130
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:19,980
By 1986 NSFNET was created by the US National
Science Foundation to interconnect supercomputers

131
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:27,519
at universities across the US, using links
running at 56kb/s. Other small networks started

132
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,369
to pop up all over the place, connecting to
the Internet.

133
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:37,999
By the end of the 1980s, there were about
100,000 connected hosts.

134
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:44,999
And then, around 1990 Tim Berners-Lee at CERN
invented the world wide web, with the first

135
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:53,149
browsers appearing in 1993 – most notably
the Mosaic browser written by Marc Andreessen.

136
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:57,999
I can still remember the day I first saw a
web browser in 1993 when I was a graduate

137
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:02,790
student. We knew immediately it would change
everything – but we didn’t realize how

138
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:08,069
huge that change would be. For many people,
this is the dawning of the Internet, although

139
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:12,790
of course we all know it goes much further
back than the world wide web. But within a

140
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,670
year, over a million people round the world
were using the Web. And before the end of

141
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:24,259
the 1990s, Yahoo, Google, Amazon and eBay
would all be household names.

142
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:29,749
If you would like to learn more about the
early days of networking and the Internet,

143
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,549
here are three excellent references that I
really enjoy.

144
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:37,519
I’d highly recommend you read them to learn
more about what led to an amazing transformation

145
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,609
of modern society.
