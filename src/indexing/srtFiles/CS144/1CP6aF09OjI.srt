00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:05,490
Phil: In this unit, we’re going to dig into
the transport layer. Recall that the transport

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,000
layer provides the service for data communication
between applications. This data communication

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,660
can, in the case of UDP be simple, unreliable
datagrams, or in the case of TCP a reliable,

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,490
bidirectional byte stream. You’ll learn
about how these transport layers work, their

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,930
abstractions, and their algorithms. You’ll
also learn a new network principle, called

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,510
the “end-to-end argument” or the “end-to-end
principle,” which governs how and where

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,499
you can implement a feature correctly.

8
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:39,210
Nick: In this unit, we’ll ask and answer
questions such as “how exactly does TCP

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,899
set up a connection?” “What do TCP segments
look like?” “How can two computers reliably

10
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:49,370
transfer data with high performance?” To
transfer data reliably, TCP needs to know

11
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,579
when data has been corrupted – you’ll
learn how to detect errors in data using three

12
00:00:54,579 --> 00:01:00,899
algorithms: checksums, cyclic redundancy checks,
and message authentication codes. You’ll

13
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,240
also learn about a basic tools and approach
to network protocol design, finite state machines,

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,979
and walk through all of the details of the
state machine TCP uses.

15
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,590
Phil: At the end of this unit, you’ll fully
understand how TCP transfers data reliably

16
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,200
and sets up connections to do so. We won’t
yet cover how TCP can be designed to run really

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,369
fast – that’s not until Unit 4, but we
will cover how it can run reasonably well

18
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,159
and, most importantly, correctly. You’ll
also know all of the details of UDP as well

19
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,340
as ICMP, the internet control message protocol,
used to carry control information like error

20
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,460
notifications in the Internet.
